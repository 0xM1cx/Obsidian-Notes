## Overview
Arrays are a type of linear data structure. In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. This is a collection of similar data elements. These data elements have the same data type. The elements of the array are stored in consecutive memory locations and are referenced by an *index(also known as the subscripts)*
	
- The number written inside the square brackets are called **subscripts**

### Dimensionality of an Array
- **One-dimensional Array** - an array with only one subscript.
- **Two-Dimensional Array** - an array with two subscripts
- **Multi- dimensional Arrays** - These are arrays of arrays. These are arrays in which the elements are also arrays. To better understand them, you can think of them as a table. Where you can access an element with x and y points.
