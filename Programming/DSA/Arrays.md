## Overview
Arrays are a type of linear data structure. In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.

- The number written inside the square brackets are called **subscripts**

### Dimensionality of an Array
- **One-dimensional Array** - an array with only one subscript.
- **Two-Dimensional Array** - an array with two subscripts
- **Multi- dimensional Arrays** - These are arrays of arrays. These are arrays in which the elements are also arrays. To better understand them, you can think of them as a table. Where you can access an element with x and y points.
