> NOTE: You can use programming language between the 3, python, C# or C. But I, Shawn from the past, recommends using C#.

## Day 1
- Understand the concept of Algorithmic Complexity. You should be able to derive both time and space complexity.

## Day 2 - 10
- Let's start by learning some simple data structures:
	- Arrays
	- Linked Lists
	- Strings
	- Stacks
	- Queue
> Understand their basic operations(insert, delete, search, traversal) and their complexity - BigO Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet, and code them all.

## Day 11 - 20
- Learn some simple algorithms
	- Searching 
	- Sorting
	- Miscellaneous

## Day 21 - 30
Once you are comfortable with everything above, start doing problems from
- Hackerrank
- Geeks for geeks
- Leetcode
- etc

## Day 31 - 40
Learn some non-linear data structures,
- Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table
- Heaps

## Day 41 - 45
Start doing problems for trees, hash tables, heaps and graphs.

## Day 46 - 50
Understand Computational Complexity theory and NP-Completeness, Knapsack problem, Travelling salesman problem, SAT problem and so on.
