**Inheritance**. Refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The class is called *derived or child class* and the one from which it inherites is called the *base or parent class*

E.g. Syntax
```Python
class BaseClass:
	pass
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
	pass
```
Derived class inherits features from the base class where new features can be added to it. This results in re-usability of code.
