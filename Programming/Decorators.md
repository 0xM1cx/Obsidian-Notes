## Decorators in Python
Python has an interesting feature called decorators to add functionality to an existing code.

This is also called *metaprogramming* becuase a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time.

We must be comfortable with the fact that everything in Python (Yes! Even classes), are [objects](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class). Names that we define are simply identifiers bound to these objects. [Functions](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function) are no exceptions, they are objects too (with attributes). Various different names can be bound to the same function object.

Such functions that take other functions as arguments are also called **higher order functions**. Here is an example of such a function.
