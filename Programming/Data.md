# DSA Introduction

## What is an Algorithm?
In computer programming, an **algorithm** is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces a desired output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers:
1. Take two number inputs
2. Add numbers using the + operator
3. Display result

### Qualities of a Good Algorithm
- Input and output should be defined precisely.
- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
- Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.  

## Data Structures and Types
### What are Data Structures?
**Data Structure** is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your project. For example, if you want to store data sequentially in the memory, then you can go for the Array data structure.

### Types of data Structures
Data structures are divided into two categories:
1. Linear Data Structure
2. Non-Linear Data Structure

#### Linear Data Structure
In this structure, elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, the are easy to implement.

However, when complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

##### Popular Data Structures are:
1. **Arrays** => is a container, which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. The elements in this array are arranged in continuous memory. And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.![[Pasted image 20220524094229.png]]
2. **Stack** => In this structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle. The last element stored in the stack will be the first one removed.

3. **Queue** => This works with FIFO principle, unlike the stack which is LIFO, the first element stored in the queue will be removed first
