## Arrays
**Array** is a container, which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structures make use.

## What is an Algorithm?
In computer programming, an **algorithm** is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces a desired output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers:
1. Take two number inputs
2. Add numbers using the + operator
3. Display result

### Qualities of a Good Algorithm
- Input and output should be defined precisely.
- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
- Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
