C# is an object-oriented programming language. In OOP, we solve complex problems by dividing them into objects.
## Class
A **Class** is a like a prototype or blueprint of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. We can build a house based on these descriptions. The house is the object.

Creating a Class:
```cs
class ClassName{
	// fields
	var product;
	string name;
	int age;

	// method
	public void bark(){
		// statements
	}
}
```
A class can contain:
- **fields** - variables to store data
- **methods** - functions to perform specific tasks
