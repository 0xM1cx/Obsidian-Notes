## Definitions
- **Data** - Raw, unprocessed facts [25, Shawn, Calbayog]
- **Information** - Processed data [Shawn is 25 years old and is from Calbayog City]
- **Database** - Collection of **related** data
- **Metadata** - The database definition. 

### Database Management System
- It is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain the database. 

#### Functionalities
- **Define** - Specifying the **data type**, **structures** and **constraints** for the data to be stored.
- **Construct** - Process of storing data on some storage medium. It facilitates/allows the construction of a database.
- **Manipulate** - Querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating database and generating reports
- **Share** - Allows multiple users and programs to access the database concurrently. 

### Properties of database
- A database represents some aspect of the real world(mini world)
- A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning
- A database is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.


## Fundamentals of Database Management Systems
### Data Models
- used to describe the structure of the database; helps to achieve data abstraction
- Includes a set of basic operations for specifying retrievals or updates on the database
- Also includes concepts to specify the behavior of a database application 
- It is a conceptual representation of how data is organized and structured in the database. It serves as a blueprint for designing and implementing a database, providing a way to understand and represent the data requirements of an organization. 

#### Categories of Data Models
##### High-level or conceptual Data Mode:
