## Basic Concepts of ER model
- The Entity-Relationship (E-R) model is based on two main constructs-entities and relationships - and their associated attributes. An entity is a 'thing' of interest in a database; for example, Employee. A relationship is an association among entities; for example, Employees assigned to Projects is an association between the entity types, Employee and Project.
- Conceptual model for designing databases
- Created by Peter Chen in 1976
- **Entities**: Entities are the objects or concepts about which data is stored in a database. For example, in a university database, entities might include students, courses, professors, and departments.
- **Attributes**: Attributes are the properties or characteristics of entities. For example, a student entity might have attributes such as student ID, name, date of birth, and major.
- **Relationships**: Relationships define how entities are related to each other. They establish connections between entities based on business rules or real-world interactions. For example, a student entity may be related to a course entity through a "takes" relationship, indicating that the student is enrolled in that course.

## Types of Attributes
- Attributes are characteristics or properties that can be identified for both entities and relationships. For example, 'job-title' could be an attribute of Employee and 'length-of- assignment' an attribute of the above relationship.
