## Evaluating Messages and/or Images of Different Types of Texts Reflecting Different Cultures
- The Advancements in technology paved the way for innovative modes and platforms in communication. The massive and rapid developments of digital communication ushered in a new era of communication that does not simply rely on words, but also on images and other semiotics of the channel used to convey the message.

### Semiotics
- Oxford Dictionary describes it as **"the study of signs and symbols and their use or interpretation."**

The widespread  use of English - spoken side by side with local languages - has given rise to local varieties of English with their own standards. Examples of World Englishes are **Indian English**, **West African English**, **Singapore English**, and **Filipino English**.

One major issue that has been raised with respect to these established varieties is that they are often not fully intelligible to used of other varieties of English. E.g. a Filipino ordering food in a restaurant in Singapore for the first time would be confused when he is asked, "Having here, or take away?" because in the Philippines, they are more accustomed to "Dine in, or Take out?".

**Kirkpatrick** proposes a scale with two extremes that characterize this problem.

**Extreme 1:** *People use a regional variety of English with its specific grammar, structure and vocabulary to affirm their own national or ethnic identity.(e.g. Only Filipinos use the terms "senatoriable" ,"congressman", "chancing", and "bedspacer")*

**Extreme2**: *The goal of intelligibility. Users of a regional variety should ideally still be readily understood by users of English everywhere else in the world to fully participate in the use of English as an international  language*
