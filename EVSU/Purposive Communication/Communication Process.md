## Verbal Communication
**Verbal Communication** - is interpersonal communication that includes *oral communication*, *written communication*, and *sign language*. Verbal Communication relies on words to convey meaning between two or more people.

## Non-verbal Communication
**Nonverbal Communication** - encompasses a whole host of physicalized nonverbal cues that convey emotional states and complement verbal messages. Nonverbal human communication involves many different parts of the body and can be either conscious or subconscious on the part of the communicator.

**Types of nonverbal communication**
- Kinesics(body movement)
- Proxemics(closeness and personal space)
- Body posture
- Haptics(touch)
- Paralanguage - which includes facial expression, speaking volume, and tone of voice.

These nonverbal cues all contribute to how verbal communication is understood, either clarifying a message or leading to a misinterpretation.

While nonverbal communication involves body language, verbal communication relies on words. There's more to it than that, however. Proper communication often requires a mix of verbal and nonverbal signs to convey meaning. 


**Consider the differences between these forms of communication and how to use them:**

Verbal communication can transpire over the phone, through email, written letters, or a face-to-face conversation. Most nonverbal communication happens only when the two or more parties can see each other.

### Intentionality
A difference between the two types of communication, verbal and nonverbal, is that the words a person chooses - verbal - tend to be intentional, whereas many elements of nonverbal communication can be unintentional or out of a person's control and impact reception. Nonverbal communication can be unconscious; for example, a person who sweats while talking may convey nervousness.

### Grammar
Verbal speech has patterns and grammar rules adhere to, whereas nonverbal communication is more fluid.

### Authenticity
Nonverbal behavior like body movements, mannerisms, or physiological responses(blinking or fidgeting) can influence communication, altering the authenticity of your spoken words or causing them to take on a different meaning. Nonverbal messages can be more powerful than verbal communication, as human bodies can subconsciously deliver messages that they are verbally not conveying - "actions speak louder than words"

### Emotions
Nonverbal cues are especially powerful when communicating with children. A parent's facial expression and tone will often express feelings more clearly than using words kids may be too young to understand fully. Nonverbal communication is also beneficial when communicating emotions between a language barrier.

### Engagement
