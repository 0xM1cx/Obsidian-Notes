## Globalization
Principally, it's an economic concept - the flow of products and services between nations. There is also a cultural element, as ideas and traditions are, in simple terms, globalization is the traded and assimilated process by which people and goods. Globalization is an intermittent process. Its impact may differ move easily across borders from time to time, but it always brings the economic, political, and social and cultural aspects of society to the global level.

The implications of globalization are perceivable to all. The global opening of markets promotes a free circulation of goods and money, as well as other world-wide services. Many individuals, enterprises and states stand to gain from this process. They will enjoy global offers of goods, services and manpower, and ultimately, a higher standard of living.

### Example of Globalization
- The first Starbucks outlet opened its doors in 1971 in the city of Seattle. Today it has 15,000 stores in 50 countries. The company was purchasing 247 million kilograms of unroasted coffee from 29 countries. Through its stores and purchases, it provided jobs and income for hundred of thousands of people all over the world.


### Disadvantages
- While some areas have flourished, others have floundered as jobs and commerce move elsewhere. Steel companies in the UK, for example, once thrived, providing work for hundreds of thousands of people. But when China began producing cheaper steel plants in the UK it closed down and thousands of jobs were lost.


## Communication in Globalization
- Global communication is directly affected by the process of globalization, and helps to increase business opportunities, remove cultural barriers and develop a global village. Both globalization and global communication have changed the environmental, cultural, political and economic elements of the world. When it comes to communicating globally, it is usually in the encoding and decoding that problems occur. As with any communication, ensuing that the message is received as it was intended is the responsibility of the sender.
- Communication at its root, global communication can be defined just as any communication can: *a message is send from one person or group to another anywhere in the world*

## Impact of Globalization on Communication
- **Virtual Interactions Globalization** has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics. Modern entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communication media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect. E.g. communicating via email to distant team members requires a certain etiquette and nuance not necessarily required in f2f interactions. When choosing a communication skills training program, look for courses that address the challenges of virtual interactions.
- **Cultural Awareness in Speech** the need for cultural awareness is a major impact of globalization on the required skillset of effective communicators, resulting in the evolution of communication skills development programs. Modern entrepreneurs and employees need the ability to catch subtle nuances of people's manner of speech when communicating across cultures. Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics. E.g. Japanese Business culture where it can be considered rude to ask personal questions in an initial business meeting. In the U.S., on the other hand, asking personal questions and sharing personal information can display warmth and openness. American and Japanese business people who understand this about each other can communication in ways that resonate more effectively with each other.
- **Cultural Awareness in Body Language** awareness of cultural differences in body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech. Modern training programs teach students to understand acceptable speaking distances, conflict styles, eye contact and posture in different cultures, accepting that the physical expressions of their own culture are not universally accepted. Look for training programs that address these differences to prepare you for face-to-face meetings with foreign suppliers, customers or team members.
- **Time Differences**. The advent of global collaboration introduces another new dynamic to communication skills - the need to communicate and share information with people across different time zones. Today's communication skills development programs should address this nuances of overcoming this challenge by teaching people to understand the information needs of their colleagues, according to the communication styles of different countries or cultures. Being able to effectively share information between shifts can make or break the productivity of a geographically dispersed team. 

## Local and Global Communication in Multicultural Setting
- **Global Communication** is the development and sharing of information, through verbal and non-verbal messages, in international settings and context.
- **Local Communication** is being able to communicate with the members of your local area. It can either be in your local language(mother tongue), or common language that you speak within your town.

### Intercultural Communication
*Inter-* is a prefix that means **between** and cultural from culture, so intercultural communication refers to the **communication between cultures**.

It is a symbolic, interpretive, transactional, contextual:

- **Process** - in which people from different cultures create shared meanings.
- **Effects** - on communication behavior when different cultures interact together
- **Intercultural Communication** - is the verbal and nonverbal interaction between people from different cultural backgrounds. 

Sometimes, this is used to describe a single person trying to interact in a foreign environment but more often,  it is a two-way street, where people from both cultures are trying to improve their communication.


## Communicating Across Cultures (by Carol Kinsey Goman, 2011)
Worldwide business organization have discovered that intercultural communication is a subject of importance - not just because of increase globalization. But also because their domestic workforce is growing more and more diverse, ethnically and culturally. We are all individuals, and no two people belonging to the same culture are guaranteed to respond in exactly the same way.

### High context
Leave much of the message unspecified, to be understood through context nonverbal cues, and between lines interpretation of what is actually said by contrast.

**Mediterranean, Slav. Central European, Latin American, African, Arab, Asia, American Indian.**

### Low Context
Expect messages to be explicit and specific

**Most Germanic and English-speaking countries**


### Sequential 
Business people give full attention to one agenda item after another, view time synchronically, as a constant flow to be experience in the moment, and as a force that cannot be contained or controlled.
**North American, English German, Swedish, and Dutch**

### Synchronic
The flow of time is viewed as a soft of circle, with the past, present, and future as interrelated. This viewpoint influences how organizations in those cultures approach deadlines, strategic thinking investments, developing talent from within and the concept of long-term planning.
**South America, Southern Europe, and Asia**

### Neutral
More careful to monitor the amount of emotion they display: **Japan, Indonesia, the UK, Norway and the Netherlands and most accepted in France, the U.S, and Singapore**

When it comes to communication, what's proper and correct in one culture may be ineffective or even offensive in another. In reality, no culture is right or wrong, better or worse just different. The key to cross-cultural success is to develop an understanding of, and a deep respect for the differences.

### Affective
Readily showing emotions, people show their feelings plainly by laughing, smiling, grimacing, scowling, and sometimes crying, shouting, or walking out of the room.
