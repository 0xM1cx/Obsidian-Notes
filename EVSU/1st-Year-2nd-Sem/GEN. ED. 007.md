## Short History of Globalization
- Early forms of Globalization - Silk Road / Columbian Exchange
**Globalization** - The words that describes the exchange in commodities, human resource, services, technology, philosophies, etc between cultures.
- **Thomas Friedman** divides globalization into 3 distinct periods
	- 1492 - 1800: The Globalization of **Countries**
	- 1800 - 2000: The Globalization of **Companies**
	- 2000 - Present: The  Globalization of **Individuals**
- **Andre Gunder Frank** and 'Archaic' Globalization
	- 3rd Millennium BCE - roots of globalization
	- Trade Links between Sumer and Indus Valley
	- The Hellenistic Period & Alexander the Great
	- The military conquest of Alexander the Great also resulted in cultural influence, as seen in name of 3 cities today in Turkey, Egypt and Iraq which derive from his name. Alexandria Troas,  Alexandria, Iskandariya
	- The widespread trade lead to the development of 'cosmopolitan culture'
- ****The Silk Road(s)
	- 2,000 years ago - land / sea routes joining China to Europe
	- Linked Persians, Somalis, Greeks, Syrians, Romans, Armenians, Indians and many others
	- Silk and many other goods traded.
	- The name silk road came from the Chinese silk, a highly valued commodity that merchants transported along these trade networks.
	- This route resulted in the introduction of different religion, technology, philosophy, and communicable diseases such as the bubonic plague, leprosy.
- **1492**
	- Seminal(strong influence in later developments) moment in the history of globalization
	- Exchange of crops and livestock - e.g. potato, corn and other commodities
	- "Columbian Exchange" - for Adam Smith, lead to a new division of labor - exchange of "surplus peltry(animal fur or raw undressed skin)"
	- Example of the importance of the Columbian Exchange - is the exchange of the banana which originated in the South America and traded in Europe

### Why is globalization different
- **Thick vs Thin Globalization**
	- Seminal moment in the history of globalization
	- David Held in Global Transformation: 
		- thin G = high extensity, low intensity, low velocity and low impact;
		- think G = high extensity, high intensity, high velocity and high impact
	- Main difference 'modern' and 'historical' G = intensity & universality
