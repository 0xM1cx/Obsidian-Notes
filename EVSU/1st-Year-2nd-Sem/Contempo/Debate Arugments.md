2. **Opening Statements**: Each team will present their opening statements, outlining their main arguments and providing a brief introduction to their position. Speakers should state their stance and support it with relevant evidence and reasoning
3. **Rebuttals**: After the opening statements, each team will have an opportunity to present rebuttals. They should address the arguments put forth by the opposing team and present counterarguments supported by evidence. It is essential to remain respectful and focused on the topic.
