1. What do you think is the fundamental role of parents to their children? What is your picture of a healthy and ideal family? Is this attainable? By your conviction, how to fulfill this when your time comes?

### Ans:
In my opinion the fundamental role of parents to their children is as mentors plus caregivers. They support, love and understand their children as well as be a mentor for them. As a mentor they give wisdom to their children about what they've encountered in their lives. This way, the children will learn early on what they should and should not do. They guide us on our journey and support us on our failures.

When it comes to a healthy and ideal family, I can think of one that isn't just financially stable but a family of means; they don't just survive but thrive; they have few to no family problems; they are complete, they are happy with each other; and they rarely fight. According to my observations, this type of family is unattainable; families, no matter how close they are, fight with each other and face various problems in their lives. In my opinion, having a healthy and ideal family can be difficult. Nonetheless, achieving a happy family, which is somewhat close to a healthy and ideal family, is possible. As I previously stated, every family will experience difficulties, but it is only through their ability to cope and adapt that they will be able to achieve happiness. According to Aristotle, the goal of every human being is to achieve happiness.

2. Do you agree the legalization of divorce in the Philippines? defend your answer.
Yes. It is a fact that not every married couple is content. We can't truly know how happy a couple is when they're alone, no matter how happy they appear to be on the outside.  According to psychologist Anna Cristina Tuazon, "divorce is not the killer of happy marriages; it is simply a life raft for people drowning in a marriage that is already long dead. If you want to ensure the success of a marriage, we should be providing couples with resources and support to help them better adapt, rather than simply mandating them to stay together." That is, divorce is simply an escape from a failed marriage.

The Catholic Church opposes it because it is "anti-marriage and anti-family," as they put it. They regard it as a "grave offense" against natural law because it claims to violate the contract, to which the spouses willingly agreed to live with each other until death.

Both the phycologist's and the Roman Catholic church's arguments, in my opinion, are correct in their terms. Neither point can decide what the couple wants; even if divorce is not legalized, there will still be couples who want to end their failed marriages. Nonetheless, I believe that divorce legalization should be implemented. Because it puts an end to those failed marriages legally.

*The legalization of divorce in the Philippines provides a legal separation of the couple. This is beneficial especially in cases of domestic abuse,*
