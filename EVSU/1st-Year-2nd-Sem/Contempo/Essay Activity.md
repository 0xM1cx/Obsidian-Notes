1. What do you think is the fundamental role of parents to their children? What is your picture of a healthy and ideal family? Is this attainable? By your conviction, how to fulfill this when your time comes?

### Ans:
In my opinion the fundamental role of parents to their children is as mentors plus caregivers. They support, love and understand their children as well as be a mentor for them. As a mentor they give wisdom to their children about what they've encountered in their lives. This way the children will know early the things to do and not to do. When it comes to a healthy  and ideal family, I can think of a family who isn't just financially stable but a family of means, they don't just survive they thrive, they have little to no family problems, they are complete, they are happy with each other, they rarely fight. This kind of family is not attainable as what I've seen, family's tend to fight with each other no matter how close they are. Furthermore, family's experience problems everyday
