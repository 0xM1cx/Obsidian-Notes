## Module 1

### Lesson 1: Importance and Recommendations of Physical Activities
- **Physical Activity** - is when skeletal muscles of the body are used in order to product movement and requires the expenditure of energy.


>**ABSTRACTION**
>
**Physical Fitness** is an important factor in order to reduce the risk of having non-transmittable diseases. One way of getting into shape is through engaging in different physical activities. These activities can be occupational, domestic, transportation or leisure. It is physical activities done during leisure time has contributed the most in order to attain physical fitness.


#### Four classifications or domains on how physical activities are done
1. Occupational or work-related
2. Domestic or Housework
3. Transportation like *walking* or *bicycling*
4. Leisure-time or hobbies and/or exercise


### Lesson 2: Fitness Concept and Assessment

>**ABSTRACTION**
>
Fitness concepts and assessment serves an important role in physical component. Fitness concepts and assessment is a valuable tool used  proper baseline measurement and can be used to monitor oneself development.


<u>A fit person has the following characteristics</u>:
- Can cope with stress and strain of everyday living
- Has a high level of cardiovascular and muscular fitness
- Has healthy social relationships
- Has an active lifestyle


### Lesson 3: Principles of Exercise and Variables

>**ABSTRACTION**
>
We have been enlightened about the different principles of exercise one has to consider if one wishes to live a healthy life and be labeled as physically fit individual. By pondering on the definition of physically fit which is, the ability to perform task without due fatigue and has extra energy in case of emergency, it is important to commit one's own self to do exercise to be more and do more in our respective walks of life.

#### principles of exercise
- **Overload** - A body  must be exercised at a level beyond which it is presently accustomed for a training effect to occur. Our human body is entitles to exert power that's beyond its normal level when you are in training. 
- **Progression** - It is an ordeal for an individual to be challenged to level up the exercise routine day-by-day to obtain results in the actual performance.
- **Recovery** - At this phase, the body must be given a chance to adjust to the attained new fitness level. It is important to spare a resting time for the muscles to adjust in its new form.
- **Individuality** - We are all unique and different from one another. Hence, we must not force someone to do a particular exercise which he/she is not capable of
- **Specificity** - A training program including muscle strengthening will train the muscle in the range that it is working and the way that the muscle is being used. In other words, the way the body responds to physical activity is very specific to the activity itself.
- **Reversibility** - Commitment is key. If you fail to adhere on you fitness training program, the tendency of going back-to-zero is possible.


## Module 2
### Lesson 1: Strength Training
- **Health** is characterized as the holistic value in terms of mental, social and physical well-being of a person not only the absence of illnesses.
- **Strength** is one of the most vital components for the success of numerous sports.
- **Strength training** is an exercise intended to develop strong capability by physical exercise to a certain muscle or number of group against external resistance.
- **Free weight** exercise is any workout where the resistance is given by an equipment.
- **Body weight** workout focuses also on the strength-training but does not require any equipment, but only body weights to supply resistance.

### Lesson 2: Endurance
**Endurance** helps enhance breathing and heart rate through aerobic and muscular endurance and helps enhance stamina, strength and health as a whole

- **Aerobic endurance**. Enhance breathing and heart rate: equal distribution of CO2 & O throughout the body, regular dispense of waste products: CO2 and Lactic Acid. Examples, are marathon runner and distant cyclist must take aerobic training for over.
- **Cardiovascular endurance** is the ability of the heart and lungs to collaborate during sustained workloads to provide assistance in generating oxygen and fuel to the body. Like jogging, cycling and swimming
- **Muscular endurance**. Enhance to work continuous contracting of muscle for a long span of time and exerting muscle for a long period: marathoner and distant cyclist. The capacity of the muscles to work continuously without fatigue.

### Lesson 3: Speed
**Speed** is not only how fast someone can run, but it depends on their acceleration, maximum movement speed, and speed maintenance as well. The speed of movement requires good strength and power, but too much body weight and air resistance can also act to slow down the person. The faster the athlete to run over a distance in a short time, outstanding speed is developed.


### Lesson 4: Coordination Training
Coordination in enhances the overall ability to help prevent injuries where multiple parts of the body come together inn executing a command. 

**Coordination** is the capability to perform smooth, precise, well-ordered exercises. Synchronized movement is described by applicable promptness, distance, timing and powerful pressure.

#### Types of coordination
**Motor Coordination**
- *Fine Motor Skills*  -  coordinated movement of small muscles(hands, face)
- *Gross Motor Skills* - coordinated movement of large muscles or groups of muscles(trunk, extremities)
- *Hand-eye Skills* - The ability of the visual system to coordinate visual information. Received and then control or direct the hands in the accomplishment of a task.
