During the pandemic, it was said that tasks would be easier to complete because we, the students, have access to all of the information we require online. This is correct; online learning did not hinder my learning during the pandemic. It simply allowed me to learn in a new way. It was also convenient because we were in the comfort of our own homes, which gave me more energy to learn. During the pandemic, I developed new learning habits such as time management and integrating my learning with my daily leisure activities; what do I mean by this? When I'm resting, I watch lecture videos instead of watching random YouTube content unrelated to my academics. However, learning was not without difficulty.  Although, learning wasn't all that easy. Because of the online setup, the STEM strand has subjects that require laboratory work. This resulted in limited learning because we lacked the necessary equipment to perform the majority of the laboratory work outlined in our textbook.



As with any IT student, our goal is to become an IT professional in the fields that we desire. I always wanted to work in IT since I started programming in my 8th grade. The world of Information Technology fascinated me and got me somewhat "addicted" to the different topics it offers. From grade 8, I jump from different topics related to IT; from programming, networking to Operating systema and Digital Forensics. The journey I've had since then was wonderful, it allowed to grow and learn things about myself. This, in turn, allowed me to complete that challenges that led to where I am now. I will continue to  work hard to achieve what I want, because I believe that the things I want are on the far side of hard work.
