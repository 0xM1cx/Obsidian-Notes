1. What is the data on which the Archimedes Model System relies
2. A physician familiar with Eddy and his work admires the logic embedded in Archimedes but says it would be difficult to sell a system like this to other hospitals, because health care is an emotionally charged issue. Do you agree with the observation?
	I agree with this observation. Health care deals with the health of human beings, they rely on health care professionals to heal they loved ones. There are decision in medicine that require human ingenuity for it to be successful. Although difficult to sell, it is still profitable as the Archimedes software better improves the decisions of medical  professionals by providing useful input based on mathematical models. This improves the efficacy healthcare.
1. Does the system replace doctors? Why or why not?
