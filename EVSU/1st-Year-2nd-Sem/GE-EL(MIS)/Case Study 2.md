1. What is the data on which the Archimedes Model System relies
	The Archimedes Model System relies on differential equations and algorithms to describe the anatomy, physiology and progress of diseases. Through this, the system can make models associated with the disease of the patient. Where did they get these info? From experts, eddy and his team took the data from the experts from different fields of medicine
2. A physician familiar with Eddy and his work admires the logic embedded in Archimedes but says it would be difficult to sell a system like this to other hospitals, because health care is an emotionally charged issue. Do you agree with the observation?

	I agree with the observation. Health care is concerned with human health; people rely on health care professionals to heal their loved ones. There are medical decisions that require human ingenuity to be successful. Although difficult to sell, the Archimedes software is still profitable because it improves medical professionals' decisions by providing useful input based on mathematical models. This increases the effectiveness of healthcare.
	
3. Does the system replace doctors? Why or why not?
