## The Natural Laws of Ethics
- **Reason** is the source of the moral law and that it directs us towards the "good".
- The "good" is the ultimate goal of the person's actions

### Three Determinants of Moral Actions of  St. Thomas Aquinas
1. **The Object of the human act** - The object refers to the specific actions or behavior itself
2. **The Intention/its End** - The intention refers to the purpose or motive behind an action
3. **The Circumstances** - Refers to the situational factors surrounding an action.

## DEONTOLOGICAL ETHICS
- Kantian ethics, developed by the philosopher **Immanuel Kant**
- It emphasizes  the importance of **rationality**, **autonomy**, **concept of duty**
- The core of Kantian ethics are the categorial imperatives

### Categorical Imperatives
- **Universalizability(Formula of Universal Law)** - one should only act on a maxim(a personal principle of action) if it can be rationally willed as a universal law without contradiction
- **Humanity as an End in Itself(Formula for Humanity)** - This principle asserts that individuals should always treat others as ends in themselves and never merely as a means to an end. 

## Kant's Notion of Morality
- Kant's notion of morality revolves around the idea that moral actions are grounded in rationality and guided by universal moral principles

### Universal Moral Principles
1. Good Will and the Moral Law
2. The Moral Law and the Categorical Imperatives
3. Autonomy and Rationality
4. Duty and Moral Obligations

## Goodwill
- Kant's notion of goodwill is a fundamental concept in his moral philosophy. He considered good will to be the highest moral virtue, the only thing that is unconditionally good and the foundation of moral actions. 
- **Goodwill** - It is the disposition to do what is morally right simply because it is the right thing to do, without being influenced by personal inclinations, desires, or external incentives.
