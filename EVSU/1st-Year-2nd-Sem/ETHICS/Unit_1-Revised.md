## Background of ethics
- The name **Ethics** is derived from the Greek work word *ethos*, which means <u>"a characteristic way of acting"</u>
- Ethics is designated as the science of human acts, of human conduct. The latin mos is the equivalent of the Greek ethos. 

## What is Ethics?
Ethics can be defined as the *"the practical science dealing with the morality of human conduct(human actions)"*
Two important elements of ethics: *Ethics as a science* and *Ethics as a Practical Science*

- **Ethics is a science** - A science is a relatively complete and systematically arranged body of connected data together with the causes or reasons by which these data are known to be true.  Ethics squares with this definition because it is a complete and systematically   arranged body of data which relate to the morality of human conduct; and it presents the reasons which show these data to be true.
- **Ethics is a practical science** - as a practical science, Ethics presents data which directly imply and indicate directions for human conduct.  The opposite of practical is speculative, *speculative science* presents truths that are to be known, but not necessarily to be acted upon.

## Material and Formal Object of Ethics
- The **Material Object** is the subject matter of the science: the thing, or things, with which the science deals. This object of ethics is *human acts*, that is to say, human conduct.
- The **Formal Object** is the aim or special way that the science employs in studying with its material object.  The formal objects of ethics is the *right morality* or*rectitude of human acts*


### Two Dimensions of Ethics
- **General Ethics** - Deals with the morality of human act that mainly focuses on the basic concepts
- **Applied or Special Ethics** - This refers to the application of moral principles, standards and norms in various specific areas of human life and activities, such as Legal Ethics for lawyers, Judicial Ethics for judges, Medical ethics for doctors, etc.

>Ethics is both THEORY and a PRACTICE

One has to know the theories or ethical principles of knowing what is right and what is wrong and good and  
bad actions. However, one has to translate these theories into actions. Knowing what is right without changing the way oneâ€™s behave morally is a useless knowledge (Fernadez, 2012


### Characteristics of Moral Principles
1. **Prescriptivity** - It refers to the action-guiding nature of morality.
2. **Impartiality** - It means that moral principles should be neutral. It should apply to anyone regardless of status or situation.
3. **Overridingness** -  It should mean that moral principles should surpass all other norms or standards of evaluation
4. **Autonomous** - Moral standards should be independent, hence, be able to stand on its own. 
5. **Publicity** - Since moral standards guide people what to do, they should be made public. Reason dictates that rules are made and promulgated to advice as well as praise or blame certain actions.
6. **Practicability** -  Rules are made for men to follow. Hence, moral standards exist in which human beings are capable of doing.

## What is Ethics
### Value and Importance of Ethics
Having a sense of morality is one of the things that differentiate us from animals. By nature, we sincerely concerned with what is right and what is wrong in human behavior. 

### Reasons for ethics to be a required course:
1. We live in a  world where we must not only make decision but where there are right ways and wrong ways.
2. In order to have any orderly social life, we must have agreements, understanding, principles, or rules of procedure. Ethics seeks the most intelligent principles of behavior, or the principles which will make life most wholesome.
3. Moral conduct and ethical systems, both of the post and the present, must be intelligently appraised and criticized. Some of them express the needs of man; some do not. Some of them are aids to wholesome living today; other are definitely hindrances. Hence, there is the constant need to study the fundamentals of morality which is not subject to change or modifications. 
4. Ethics seeks to point out to men true values of life. It attempts to stimulate the moral sense, discover the true values of life and inspire men to join the quest for these values.
5. Faulty ethical theories, as well as the lack of definite ethical principles, have been and are still the cause of great disorders in the political and social world

## What is Human act?
- **Human Act** is an act which proceeds from the *deliberate free will of man*. In a wide sense, the term human act means any sort of activity, internal or external, bodily or spiritual performed by a human being. 
- **Acts of man** are those acts that man performs indeliberately  or without the full exercise of free choice. Thus, such acts are affected in sleep, in delirium, in the state of unconciousness.

### Constituents of Human Acts
In order that an act be human, it must possess three essential elements:
- Knowledge, Freedom, Voluntariness

1. **Knowledge** - here means the act whereby the intellect perceives the action that the person is about to perform or is performing. 
2. **Freedom** is the capacity to act or not to act(freedom of exercise), or to choose this thing in preference to others(freedom of specification)
3. **Voluntariness** The latin word for *voluntas*, and from this word we derive the English terms, *voluntary* and *voluntariness*. The other condition that is necessary for an act to be morally imputable to a person is that the person must do it with consent

### Modifiers of Human Acts
By the modifiers of human acts we mean the things that may affect human acts in the essential qualities of knowledge, freedom, voluntariness, and so make them less perfectly human. Such modifiers lessen the moral character of the human act. 
#### Ignorance.
Is the absence of knowledge-and, for our purpose here, it may be defined as *the absence of intellectual knowledge in man*. This is the *negation of knowledge*, it is a negative thing. We are to consider ignorance in its effect upon human acts by considering it in two ways, that is, **in its Object**, meaning it the thing of which a person may be ignorant;**in its Subject**, that is, in the person in whom ignorance exist.
1. *Ignorance in its Object* - The thing of which a person may be ignorant is a matter of law fact or penalty
	- **Ignorance of Law** - is the ignorance of the existence of duty, rule, or regulation
	- **Ignorance of Fact** - is ignorance of the nature of circumstance of an act as forbidden
	- **Ignorance of Penalty** - is the lack of knowledge of the precise sanction
2. **Ignorance in its subject** -  in the person in whom it exist, ignorance(of law, fact, or penalty) is either vincible or invincible
	- **Vincible Ignorance** - is ignorance that can be dispelled by the use of ordinary diligence. Such ignorance, therefore, due to lack of proper diligence on the part of the ignorant person, and is his fault.
	- **Invincible Ignorance** - is ignorance that ordinary and proper diligence cannot dispel. This sort of ignorance is attributable to one of two causes, namely: *either the person in whom the ignorance exists has no realization whatever of his lack of knowledge,* or *the person who realizes his ignorance finds ineffective his effort to dispel it*
	

#### Fear
It is one of the passions, and it included under the general denotation of the term concupiscence, but it is usual to give special mention in Ethics because it is a very common passion, and we should know in detail its relation to the morality of acts, and because it has a characteristic distinctive among the passions.

#### Violence
It is also known as **coaction**. It is defined as the external force applied by a free cause for the purpose of compelling a person to perform an act which is against his will . Violence cannot reach the will directly. It may force bodily action, but the will is not controlled by the body, rather, the body is controlled by the will

#### Habit
By habit ethics understands operative habit, which is a lasting readiness and facility, born frequently repeated acts, for action in certain matter. Thus a man who has the always endeavor to speak the truth, has a habit of truthfulness.
