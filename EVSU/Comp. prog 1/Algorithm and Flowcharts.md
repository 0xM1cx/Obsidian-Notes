## Algorithm?
- It is a step by step solution of any given problem or task.

### Example
Suppose you want to go to the market to buy grocery then the algorithm for the same can be as follows.

STEP 1: Start
STEP 2: Get ready and take the money and bags
STEP 3: go to the market
STEP 4: find the groceries to buy
STEP 5: pay the bill
STEP 6 take back the groceries to home
STEP 7: Stop

### Advantages of writing an algorithm
- When we divide the solution into steps it becomes easy for the readers to understand the process. So with algorithms we can make it easy to write solutions of bigger problems/questions.

## Flow Chart
- it is a diagrammatic representation of any algorithm

### Why Flow Chart
If we convert the algorithm into steps it becomes easy for anyone to understand the step as graphical representation is way better than textual representation.
