### Quantitative Research Process
**Quantitative Research** is a strategy which involves the collection of numerical data, a deductive view of the relationships between theory and research, a preference for a natural science approach and an objectivist conception for social reality.

### The different research designs
Research design is the method that researchers select to organize their research project or study. 
#### Quantitative Designs
- Descriptive & Correlational Designs - Aim to measure variables and describe relational between them. 
	- Descriptive - Focuses on systematically measuring variables. This is to describe a research topic, so this type of research is useful when you need more information about your topic. It focuses on describing existing conditions, behavior or characteristics. 
	- Correlational Design - Tests whether variables are related to each other. You measure variables but do not alter them. 
	- Experimental Design - Is useful when you want to test how different factors affect a situation, making this design type very versatile. This design uses the scientific method, which includes elements like:
		- **Hypothesis**: Is a statement that describes what you predict your research to reveal
		- **Independent Variables**: Is a variable that does not depend on other variables. This variable is manipulated or controlled by the researcher. It is the presumed cause or predictor variable. 
		- **Dependent Variable**: Is a variable that depends on another variable. This is the outcome or response that is being measures or observed in the experiment.
		- **Control Variable**: Is a variable that remains constant throughout a research experiment. They are important for ensuring that any observed changes in the dependent variable are indeed due to changes in the independent variable not due to other factors. 
	- Quasi-experimental - Similar to experimental research design but lacks full control over the independent variable(s). In a quasi-experimental study, researchers do not have complete control over the assignment of participants to experimental conditions. Instead, participants may be assigned to  groups based on pre-existing characteristics or other non-random methods. 
#### Qualitative Designs
- Case studies - This is choosing a subject and gathering detailed data on it. They involve an in-depth examination of a single individual, group, event or organization, aiming to understand its complexities and dynamics. 
- Ethnographies - This involve gathering data about the culture of a group or organization by immersing yourself in the community.
