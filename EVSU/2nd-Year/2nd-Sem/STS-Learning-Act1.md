The name is derived from the major functionalities of my technology which is the artificially advanced automated decision making and inter-device communication. For those unfamiliar with these kinds of technology, this kind of tech has been used in different countries around the world. In particular, South Korea's emergency bells, which are installed on electrical poles, play a crucial role in crime prevention and are frequently deployed alongside CCTV systems (Lee et al., 2023). My technology augments this technology by having the ability of the IoT devices to be able to communicate not just to emergency responders, but also with each other. Having artificially advanced automated decision making with other devices allows for a quicker transferring of information to the intended responder. This extra advancement in decision making is necessary because the device will have three different buttons, one for the contacting the nearest police, one for the fire station and another for the nearest hospital. This is so that the appropriate responder will be called. Furthermore, another extended technology will also be created, similar to the Zikim devices (keychain like push buttons) used in South Korea. This device will have the additional functionality of communicating to the nearest ALERT devices installed on electrical polls, allowing for a wireless transmission of the alert message when the individual is unable to go to the device. The idea came from a mugging incident my friend experienced and a social experiment in South Korea regarding a person asking for help crossing a street with no lights. There are places in our country that people can be vulnerable to index and non-index crime, such as murder and rape, careless unlawful death and non-aggravated assault respectively to name a few (Asor & Sapin, 2020). Furthermore, not every street will have a police patrol every hour hence the use of IoT technology can augment the emergency responding capabilities of our police force. Given that this technology has already been invented and I only intend to augment the technology to include advanced automaton in its operations; that is making intelligent decisions and responses without human intervention. I would classify this as an innovation. 

Emergency systems like these have been installed in public places in South Korea, like parks, bathrooms, and streets with a history of crime. These allow south Koreans to just push a bell and the nearest police station is alerted with information of your current location. 

The name "Artificial Logistic Emergency Response Technology" (ALERT) is derived from the core functionalities of the technology, namely artificially advanced automated decision-making and inter-device communication. Building upon existing emergency response systems, particularly inspired by South Korea's deployment of emergency bells on electrical poles for crime prevention (Lee et al., 2023), ALERT enhances communication capabilities among IoT devices. This augmentation facilitates quicker information transfer to emergency responders. The system incorporates three buttons for contacting the nearest police, fire station, and hospital, ensuring appropriate responses. Additionally, ALERT extends its functionality through devices similar to South Korea's Zikim devices, enabling wireless transmission of alerts to nearby ALERT devices on electrical poles. The conceptualization of ALERT stemmed from a mugging incident experienced by a friend and a social experiment in South Korea. Given the vulnerability to various  index and non-index crimes in certain areas (Asor & Sapin, 2020), coupled with the limitations of police patrols, ALERT leverages IoT technology to enhance emergency response capabilities. Classified as an innovation, ALERT aims to augment existing technology by integrating advanced automation for intelligent decision-making and response without human intervention.

This technology can help with various emergencies such as the following:
- Crimes against women
- Theft
- Medical emergencies, a bystander having to press a button is much faster than calling an emergency number
- Situations like fires and road accidents can also be facilitated with this technology.

## Gathered Data
- In this article [Seoul Offers 10,000 sets of portable SOS emergency bell 'Zikimi'](https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231107000532) (Nov 7, 2023), it has stated that the Seoul metropolitan government announced Tuesday that it will distribute a portable SOS emergency bell called **Zikimi** as part of a campaign to relieve citizen's anxiety caused by a series of violent crimes. 
	- Once activated, it sends out a warning alert that can call for help around the area and an emergency text message containing location information is sent to five pre-set acquaintances by the user.
	- The warning alert is also capable of a silent function.
	- It is equipped with an automatic police reporting system that alerts the police 20 seconds after the device activated. 
- There are emergency bells in public restrooms in South Korea. This [article](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/society/10918523) explains more.
- The emergency in bathrooms are connected wirelessly to a nearby police station and patrol cars. They will sound an alarm and flicker a red warning light to chase away potential criminals.
