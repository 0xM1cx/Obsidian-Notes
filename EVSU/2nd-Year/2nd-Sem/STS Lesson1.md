- Teaching and learning of science in the context of human experience(Yager, 1992).
- Confluence(junction or merging) of variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields that view science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.
- Discipline embodying the relationship of science and technology and how the two shape the society and vice - versa
- IE: It refers to the intersection or merging point of different academic fields and subfields that approach science and technology with the understanding that they are deeply intertwined with society.

## Historical Developments of STS
- Originated from the United Kingdom as **science in society**(Lewis, 1891) and as **science in social context**(Solomon, 1983)
- Many attempts were made in the United States to initiate STS programme in the Secondary Schools; but **did not get underway until 1981**(report of Norris Harm's Project Synthesis Study[PSS])
- After Decades, STS gains recognition and its national professional body **National Association for Science Technology Society(NASTS)**
- Several Major **National Science Foundation(NSF)** grants were awarded to foster STS projects including **Rusttum Roy in 1985** which supported a project known as **science through STS**.
- In the Philippines, UP launched its **Science, Technology and Society(STS) program in 1987** to *explore how the science and society interact*
- Educators called STS as the **central goal for Science education**
