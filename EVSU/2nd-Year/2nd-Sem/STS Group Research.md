	- Following the trends in the use of artificial intelligence for innovations and ethical considerations for the environment, I decided to come up with an innovation, which is a solar-powered smart greenhouse. It is an automated greenhouse system that uses solar panels to power its operation and an AI system that monitors and optimizes the greenhouse environment.

	- So, my innovation is creating a new tool that has all the features of a money brailler and a cash reader. Let me explain what they do first, a money brailler is a tool that adds braille markings to bills helping blind people know what type of bill they are holding, while a cash reader is a small scanner that reads out what kind of bill is being scanned, these two tools are commonly used in tandem by blind people to mark their own money. My idea is that these two tools should be one item for better accessibility.

	- Biowrap  packaging. Packaging that would be the most succinct and descriptive name for the idea that I have conceptualized. the idea is of a paper-based alternative packaging solution various food items like chips or business. Overall, 80% of marine waste is plastic waste, and a significant portion of that composes of single use packaging.
