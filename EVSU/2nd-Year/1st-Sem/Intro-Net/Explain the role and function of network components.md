- **Computer Network** - is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. These  nodes are *routers*, *switches*, *firewall*, *server*, *client*.
- A **Client** is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
## Routers

| Cisco Routers |     | 
| ------------- | --- |
| ISR 1000      |     |
| ISR 900       |     |
| ISR 4000      |     |
- Routers have fewer network interfaces that switches
- They are used to provide connectivity *between* LANs
- They are therefore used to send data over the Internet.

## Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches
- Switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to(usually 24+)
- They provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
- Layer 2 switches do no provide connectivity between LANs/ over the Internet

### Layer 3 Switch
- A layer 3 switch combines the functionality of a switch and a router. It acts as a switch to connected devices that are on the same subnet or VLAN at lightning speed and has IP routing Intelligence built into it to double up as a router. 
- It can support routing protocols, inspect incoming packets, and can even make routing decision based on the source and destination addresses. 

## Next-generation firewalls and IPS
## Access Points
## Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)
## Endpoints
## Servers
- This is a device that provides functions or services for clients. 
- The client can also be a server, because they can also provide services to other nodes. 
## PoE
