### Operating Systems
- The operating system (OS) is the middleware that controls the hardware and the applications that run on it. It is the operating system software platform on which applications run. When a user interacts with the computer via input devices or does something using the application software in the OS, it sends a signal to the hardware to process the instruction. The Operating System facilitates all of this from input and output.
