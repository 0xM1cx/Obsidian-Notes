1. What are the two main purposes of the operating system?
	- Manage computer resources
	- serves and provides a user interface for the computer for users, as well as a platform for applications to run on. 
2. List the four steps necessary to run a program on completely dedicated machine.
	- Reserve machine time
	- Manually load program into memory
	- Load Starting address and begin execution
	- Monitor and control execution of program from console
3. Why is Distributed Operating System called a loosely coupled system?
   - A Distributed Operating System (DOS) is often referred to as a "loosely coupled system" because its individual network nodes or machines can operate independently, making their own decisions and managing local resources. These nodes are only loosely connected, and their interactions are usually limited to specific needs, allowing for flexibility and adaptability. Because of the decentralized control, limited interaction, and component independence, it is a loosely coupled system that is suitable for scalability, fault tolerance, and heterogeneity.
4. Differentiate Distributed Operating System from Network Operating System
5. In a multiprogramming and time-sharing environment, several users share the system simultaneously. This situation can result in various security problems.
		a. What are two such problems. One such problem is Race condition in which the results depends on the timing of the events which can lead to unpredictable behavior like when a process is following a variable concurrently. Another problem is Privilege Escalation which gives unauthorized access at higher privilege levels. 
		b. Can we ensure the same degree of security in a time-shared machine as we have in dedicated machine? Explain your answer. 
6. What is the main advantage of multiprogramming. 

- Better CPU utilization means that instructions can be processed faster and throughput is increased, resulting in improved computer system performance.
