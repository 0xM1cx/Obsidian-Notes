## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, and classes serve as blueprints for these objects OOP is founded on several key principles

### Benefits of OOP
1. **Modularity**. OOP allows you to break down a complex software system into smaller mana 
2. **Reusability**
3. **Scalability**
4. **Readability and Maintainability**
5. **Collaboration**


## OOP Concepts
To implement OOP in PHP effectively. You need to understand the following key concepts:
1. Classes
2. Objects
3. Encapsulation(Access Modifiers)
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism


## PHP as an OOP Language
PHP is a versatile server-side scripting language known for its ability to support multiple programming paradigms including procedural and object-oriented programming. Over the years, PHP has evolved to become a robust OOP language by incorporating key features and syntax that align with OOP principles. 


## Classes and Objects
**Classes**. A class in PHP can be thought of as a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects based on the class will have.
**Objects**. are instances of classes. If a class is a blueprint, an object is an actual instantiation or realization of that blueprint. You can create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own unique state and behavior. 



### Class Structure
**Properties(Attributes)**. These are variables that belong to a class and represent its attributes define the state of an object. In PHP, properties are declared using visibility modifiers like public, private, or protected.

**Methods(Functions)**. Are functions defined within a class that describes the behavior or actions objects of that class perform.
