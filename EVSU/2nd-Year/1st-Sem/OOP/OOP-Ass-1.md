Research 10 real World Applications example and describe and explain the uses of each.

1. OOP in Video Games. In video games, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) plays a role in creating game characters. It helps in representing characters, including their health, skills, and the number of coins they have. 
   
2. OOP in Banks. They are used as account profiles or representations in the system. They are used to store financial data about the account holder, such as their balance, card ID, etc.
   
3. OOP in Robotics. They are used in modeling the parts of the machine, the sensors, algorithms, etc.
   
4. OOP in Healthcare Systems. They are used in healthcare system software for patient data such as their medical history, treatment plans, health status; all these can help in modeling patient data for improved healthcare.
    
5. OOP in E-Commerce. They are used in product modeling, customer modeling to help in data management. They are used in companies like Amazon, Shopee, Lazada and more. 
   
6. OOP in Simulations. They are used in algorithms for modeling real-world data. These include weather data like in Accuweather, internal human biological modeling such as in medical research; they use it in their algorithims to simulate how, for example, blood flow in the body.
   
7. OOP in AI. They are used in Artificial Intelligence systems for things like training data, learning, and so on. Deep Mind's AI "Alpha Fold" is one example of a use case. In their algorithms that predict how proteins fold, they used Object Oriented Programming.
    
8. OOP in GUI Applications. For example, the Packet Tracer by Cisco has a login window once you first install the application in this GUI, different areas such as the packet tracer info, user profile, and so on can be represented by objects. 
   
9. OOP in Social Media Platforms. OOP can be used to represent a social media post, for example, with features such as delete, picture, content, public interactions, and comments. A good example is Facebook posts, where developers use classes as the blueprint for the post and allow for variable content when the class is instantiated. 
   
10. OOP in the Military. Countries in the modern world require modern armies. OOP is used in a variety of contexts, including algorithms for drones, planes, and even internal personnel management. In the Philippine military, intelligence gathering software is used, and this software uses OOP to represent the information gathered on the battlefield.
