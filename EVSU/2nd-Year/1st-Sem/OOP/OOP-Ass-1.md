Research 10 real World Applications example and describe and explain the uses of each.

1. OOP in Video Games. In video games, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) plays a role in creating game characters. It helps in representing characters, including their health, skills, and the number of coins they have. 
   
2. OOP in Banks. They are used as account profiles or representations in the system. They are used to store financial data about the account holder, such as their balance, card ID, etc.
   
3. OOP in Robotics. They are used in modeling the parts of the machine, the sensors, algorithms, etc.
   
4. OOP in Healthcare Systems. They are used in healthcare system software for patient data such as their medical history, treatment plans, health status; all these can help in modeling patient data for improved healthcare.
    
5. OOP in E-Commerce. They are used in product modeling, customer modeling to help in data management. They are used in companies like Amazon, Shopee, Lazada and more. 
   
6. OOP in Simulations. They are used in algorithms for modeling real-world data. These include weather data like in Accuweather, internal human biological modeling such as in medical research; they use it in their algorithims to simulate how, for example, blood flow in the body.
   
7. OOP in AI. They are used in Artificial Intelligence systems in areas such as training data, learning, etc. An example of a use case would be Deep Mind, in their AI "Alpha Fold". They used Object Oriented Programming in their algorithms that predict how proteins fold.
    
8. OOP in GUI Applications. All Graphical User Interface applications have different featured to then, for example, the Packet Tracer by Cisco has a login window once you first installed the application in this GUI, different areas such as the packet tracer info, user profile, etc. can be represented by objects. 
   
9. OOP in Social Media Platforms. OOP can be used to represent, for example, social media post; post contain features like delete, picture, content, public interactions and comments. A great example would be Facebook posts, where developers use classes as blueprint for the post and allows varied content when the class is instantiated. 
   
10. OOP in the Military. In the modern world, countries require modern armies. OOP is used in different ways, such as in algorithms for drones, planes, or even in house personnel management. In the Philippine military they have software used for intelligence gathering and these software uses OOP to represent the intel they get on the field.
