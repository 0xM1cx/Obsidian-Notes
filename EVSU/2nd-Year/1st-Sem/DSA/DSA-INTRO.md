## What are Data Structures?
**Data structure** is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

## Types of Data Structure
- [[#Linear Data Structure]]
- [[#Non-Linear Data Structure]]



## Linear Data Structure
- In this structure, the elements are arranged in a sequence one after the other. 
- This kind of structure is easy to implement because the elements are arranged in particular order. 

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structure might not be the best choice because of operational complexities. 

1. [[Arrays]]
2. [[Stacks]]
3. [[Queues]]
4. [[Linked Lists]]


## Non-Linear Data Structure
- In this structure, the elements are not in any sequence.  
- The elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

1. [[Graph]] Data Structure
2. [[Trees]] Data Structure


| Linear Data Structure                                                          | Non Linear Data Structure                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other                    | Items are arranged in non-sequential order(hierarchical manner)                                                                                |
| All items are present on the single layer                                      | Items are present on different layers                                                                                                          |
| It can be traversed in a single run, from the first to the last, sequentially. | It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass. |
| Memory Utilization is not efficient                                            | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need.                                                         |
| Time complexity increases with the data size                                   | Time complexity remains the same                                                                                                                                               |
