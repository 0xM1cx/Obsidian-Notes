## Make an Algorithm and Flowchart
1. Create an algorithm for the following procedures
	- How to enroll
	- How to buy a cellular phone
2. Explain in detail about top-down approach and bottom-up approach with suitable programming examples
	- In a top-down approach it start with a high-level view of the problem then gradually divides the problem/system into smaller parts(modules or functions in programming)
	- In a bottom-up approach programmers make 
1. Explain the term "data structure"
	- Data structures are methods for organizing data so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. This avoids unnecessary bottlenecks that could have been avoided with proper data storage. They are the building blocks used in the design and implementation of algorithms and software systems. They provide a structured and efficient means of storing and managing data, making various computational tasks easier to perform. Arrays, queues, linked lists, stacks, trees, and hash tables are common data structures.
	- Overall, data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, and they are required for designing efficient algorithms and developing software systems that can effectively manage, process, and manipulate data.

2. What are the uses of an array? What is an ordered array?
	- An array is a linear data structure in which elements are sequentially stored in memory. Its purpose is to store data. Arrays are used to store data with the same data type in programming languages such as C/C++, C#, and others. Python, on the other hand, can store multiple data types in a single array. Nonetheless, the concept works in memory the same way. This is done so that instead of creating multiple variables to store data, programmers can represent a list of data with a single variable.
	   
	- An ordered array is an ordinal array, which means that the elements are arranged in ascending or descending order. In this manner, search algorithms can access elements more efficiently than in an unsorted array. Further research indicates that an ordered array is not recommended when frequent insertion and deletion will occur because data is sorted in order; if a new element is placed that is out of order, the order of elements will need to be rearranged, which is undesirable, especially on larger arrays. 
5. What do you mean by stepwise refinement?
	- This is a design approach that emphasizes breaking down complex problems into smaller partitions in order to manage and understand each partition of the problem. It is also known as a top-down approach. This makes system development easier because it is divided into subtasks that allow engineers to focus on problems one at a time.
