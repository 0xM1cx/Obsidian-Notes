## Make an Algorithm and Flowchart
1. Create an algorithm for the following procedures
	- How to enroll
	- How to buy a cellular phone
2. Explain in detail about top-down approach and bottom-up approach with suitable programming examples
	- 
3. Explain the term "data structure"
	- Data Structure are methods in arranging data in a way that  makes it efficient when accessed or updated. This prevents unnecessary bottle necks that could've been solved by proper storing of data. They serve as the building blocks for designing and implementing algorithms and software systems. They provide a structured and efficient means to store and manage data, making it easier to perform various computational tasks. Common Data Structures used are arrays, queues, linked lists, stacks, trees and hash tables.
	- Overall, data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, essential for designing efficient algorithms and building software systems that can manage, process, and manipulate data effectively.

1. What are the uses of an array? What is an ordered array?
	- 
2. What do you mean by stepwise refinement?
### Algorithm
#### How to Enroll
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Pre-registration
Step 3: Registration for Free Higher Education
Step 4: Evaluation of Grades, Advising & Controlling of Subjects
Step 5: Approval of COR
Step 6: Student Registration
Step 7: Assessment of Fees
Step 8: Students Attend Class

#### How to buy a cellular phone
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Go to nearest Electronic/Phone Store
Step 3: Ask the seller what Phone Brand you want
Step 4: Pick one Cellular Phone from the numerous flavors of the brand picked
Step 5: Present the desired phone to the seller
Step 6: Give payment to the seller
Step 7: Seller processes the payment and packs phone
Step 8: Get the phone and go home.
