Dear Dr. Jose Rizal 

As I write this letter , a deep appreciation and respect well up within me for the unwavering spirit you exemplified in your era. Your contributions, principles, and sacrifices have etched an enduring imprint on the annals of history, serving as a perennial wellspring of inspiration for successive generations.

Your acts and actions demonstrate your intelligence and dedication to justice. You launched a revolution in the hearts and minds of the Filipino people during persecution by using the power of the pen.

Your devotion to education as a vehicle for emancipation and national identity is a guiding star; it has pushed me to work hard on my studies because I know I can contribute to the community and my country. 

In today's challenging world, your timeless wisdom envisions a society grounded in justice, education, and unity. May your spirit inspire passion for justice and freedom in those following your path.

Thank you, Dr. Jose Rizal, for your unparalleled contributions to the cause of liberty and enlightenment. Because of you, I am proud to be a Filipino and I am proud and filled with great pride to call you my hero. 

With profound respect and gratitude,

Shawn Michael A. Sudaria
