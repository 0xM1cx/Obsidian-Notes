What is your comment about the issue?
 - This is another case of oligarchs taking advantage of their wealth, power, and influence to take what they want. In this case, we know that the sugar plantation owned by the Cojuanco-Aquino Family. Although the initial agreement was to distribute the land after 10 years, when some families gets this powerful they would do anything to keep that power. The sugar can plantation is one if not the reason for the wealth of the Cojuanco-Aquino. The profits they gained allowed them to boost they social status, meet influential people and become influential themselves. So I would say, it is one of their family's most pride assets. 
 - Our farmers are the backbone of our economy, as an emerging market and a newly industrialized country and produce is essential to feed the society. Our farmers are an essential work force. With this they way they are treating the farmers is not fair, not only did they not abide by the agreement, they didn't give the farmers the required salary and proper working conditions to, if a lack of a better word, work productively and support their family. These farmers are one of the original plantation custodians even during the Spanish colonization era. 

1. What is the issue presented in the documentary
- The issue presented 
2. Who were involved in the land conflict
- The Cojuanco-Aquino Family, the farmers that are part of the estate,
3. Why were the land tenants protesting against the land administrators of Hacienda Luisita?
- Because of the way the tenants are treated like the low salary, furthermore, the original administrator, the late Jose Cojuanco, made a agreement that the land will be distributed back to the tenants after 10 years. But as what happened, that agreement wasn't met. 
4. How did the land administrators respond to the demands of the tenants?
	- Over the years, they engaged in a number of different activities that finally delayed the agreement's completion. In 1988 the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program was in place to distribute land to the farmers, where Hacienda Luisita being the biggest. However, the powerful Cojuangco family in Philippine politics came under fire for using the stock distribution option (SDO), which gave farmers stocks rather than real property, and for the sluggish land distribution under the CARP, resulting in a sham of a Program in that region.
5. What is your personal point of view on the issue?
	- Oligarchs exploited their wealth, power, and influence to retain control, as seen in the Cojuanco-Aquino Family's sugar plantation case. Despite the agreed-upon land distribution after a decade, their clout led them to disregard the deal. The plantation is a key source of the family's prosperity, enabling social elevation and influence. Regrettably, the mistreatment of farmers, crucial to our economy, contradicts fair labor practices. The farmers, descendants of plantation custodians from the Spanish era, endure inadequate wages and working conditions, undermining their ability to sustain themselves.
