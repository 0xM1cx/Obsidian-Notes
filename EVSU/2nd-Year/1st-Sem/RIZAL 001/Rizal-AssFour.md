My Caricature depicts Fr. Horacio De la Costa. 

## Caricature Interpretation

- What lesson and specific subtopic is illustrated in your caricature? 
	- This was covered in lesson 1 when we talked about Rizal, including why it was contentious, why did some senators oppose the bill and how it affected today's young, what was the aim of the Rizal bill and how did the senate resolve the conflict between the pro-Rizal bill and the anti-Rizal bill. In my caricature, the subtopic it illustrated was of Fr. Horacio de la Costa and his unbiased, balanced and rational judgement on Rizal and hi Novel 
- Who is your inspiring person/group of persons that you would like to portray in your presentation?
	- The person I would like to portray would be Fr. Horacio De la Costa
- Using your caricature, explain the reason how that person/group of persons inspired you.
	- We discovered in the class how Fr. De la Costa's opinion of Rizal and his writings about him and his novels. His opinions were not at all in line with those of the Catholic Church. In light of the fact that his writings would have compromised the church's integrity, the clergy was dubious about him. Nevertheless, he was impartial in his writing of the letter. Because of this, I gave him a large head to symbolize knowledge, glasses to hide his eyes to symbolize stoicism, and, finally, a smile and peace sign to symbolize his somewhat rebellious nature. He writes what he wants to write without worrying about the biased opinions that might arise, and rather than giving up, he simply gestures amiably to his enemies.

## Synthesis 2
### Economic
- 
### Political
- During the 19th century the Cadiz Constitution was created. It was a landmark event that some of the Philippine delegates who came from the Philippines participated. This constitution embraced the principles of freethinking and equality of all citizens. Liberalism in Europe, the intense struggle between the liberals and conservatives inspired the natives and creoles to claim equality with the Spaniards. 
### Sociocultural
- 

### Task C and D
- Rizal was a very academic person. He viewed learning as a hobby and a stress reliever. He sees the values and the impact of gaining knowledge and would take what ever measure necessary, even going across the world, to get the right education that he needs. 
- This could be a double edge sword. As I see it, this has a benefit for the Filipino youth to learn a new language that will get them more job opportunities in other countries, improving their livelihood. But as we see in modern society, the new generation are more influenced by foreign countries, this could cause future generations to neglect their status as a Filipino, and put the sacrifices our ancestors have made to vain. If in my school, other languages are offered, I would take that opportunity to learn a new language, but I would also be using my native language outside and on the internet. 
## Lesson 3
1. Was Rizal a Filipino? Explain your answer
   - Yes, Jose Rizal was a Filipino, for the reason that he was born in the Philippines, specifically in Calamba Laguna. 
2. How did the Rizal family get its surname?
   - In 1849, the Narciso Claveria, the Governor-General, ordered all Filipinos to use Spanish family names to facilitate tax-census registry. So their family changed used "Mercado" as their surname. Then Jose Rizal used "Rizal" as his surname, which was the first in their family, to avoid any association with the executed Fr. Burgos who happened to have a connection with his older borther, Paciano Mercado 
3. Give one important factor that could have contributed to Rizal's intellectual development.
   - A better environment for learning, where he wouldn't be discriminated, teachers were more eager to teach no matter the status of the student and a more modern teaching methodologies. These kinds of environment could have propelled Jose Rizals Intellect to greater heights, he could have had people, other students, to help him in his struggles, instead of having to fight a lot of people, he could've collaborated with others to solve societal problems.

## Lesson  4
### Warmup activity
1. Chiba Prefecture, Japan -  Japan was always my dream country to visit. Especially the Chiba Prefecture, it is where one of my favorite shows were filmed. I like how Chiba is situated near Tokyo it's like this goldilocks zone, so its a perfect mix of a sub urban area where there isn't too much noise of the big city and also close to Tokyo were you can find all the things you need.
2. Berlin, Germany - I see Berlin as a place where one of the worlds greatest minds and inventions were made from the area of Physics, Philosophy, Medicine, Chemistry, Computing Technology and more. I particularly like it due to the fact that the cybersecurity scene in Berlin is very ubiquitous. 
3. Shenzhen, China - As a Technology nerd, this city is one of my favorite. Shenzhen is also known as China's Tech Megacity; I kind of think of it as a toy store for technology nerds. It is where you can find all sorts of hardware electronics, robots, open-source software and other fun stuff.  
4. Toronto, Canada - I always to see hockey games on T.V, going to Canada, it would be nice to see a game up close.
