	- This was in lesson 1 when we discussed about the Rizal, why was it controversial, what were the stances if each party, and how has it impacted our youth today.
- Who is your inspiring person/group of persons that you would like to portray in your presentation?
	- The person I would like to portray would be Fr. Horacio De la Costa
- Using your caricature, explain the reason how that person/group of persons inspired you.
	- In the lesson, we learned how Fr. De la Costa viewed Rizal and what he wrote about him and his books. His view didn't really coincide with the view of the Catholic Church. For context, the church were skeptical of his books as it would have caused a negative impact on the integrity of the church. Nonetheless, while writing the letter he wrote it in a nonpartisan way.  For this reason I portrayed him with a big head that portrays knowledge, glasses that hide the eyes that shows his stoicity and lastly his smile and peace sign to show his sort of rebellious nature, that will to write what is write without fear of the biased opinions that might arise, instead of surrendering he just gives his enemies a friendly gesture.
