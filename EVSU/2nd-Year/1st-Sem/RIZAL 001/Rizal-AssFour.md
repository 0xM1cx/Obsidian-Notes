## Caricature Interpretation

- What lesson and specific subtopic is illustrated in your caricature? 
	- This was covered in lesson 1 when we talked about Rizal, including why it was contentious, why did some senators oppose the bill and how it affected today's young, what was the aim of the Rizal bill and how did the senate resolve the conflict between the pro-Rizal bill and the anti-Rizal bill. In my caricature, the subtopic it illustrated was of Fr. Horacio de la Costa and his unbiased, balanced and rational judgement on Rizal and hi Novel 
- Who is your inspiring person/group of persons that you would like to portray in your presentation?
	- The person I would like to portray would be Fr. Horacio De la Costa
- Using your caricature, explain the reason how that person/group of persons inspired you.
	- We discovered in the class how Fr. De la Costa's opinion of Rizal and his writings about him and his novels. His opinions were not at all in line with those of the Catholic Church. In light of the fact that his writings would have compromised the church's integrity, the clergy was dubious about him. Nevertheless, he was impartial in his writing of the letter. Because of this, I gave him a large head to symbolize knowledge, glasses to hide his eyes to symbolize stoicism, and, finally, a smile and peace sign to symbolize his somewhat rebellious nature. He writes what he wants to write without worrying about the biased opinions that might arise, and rather than giving up, he simply gestures amiably to his enemies.
