- From my Father. He is our country's national hero who was killed by colonists. He wrote two novels(Nole me tengere, El filibusterismo) that inspired our forefathers to fight for freedom and opened their eyes to what's happening. 
- From my Mother. In 1892, Rizal founded the La Liga Filipina organization to promote civic consciousness and political reforms. Regrettably, it was disbanded soon after his arrest.
- From my younger Bother.  Jos√© Rizal's novels, ideas, and devotion to the Philippines continue to inspire Filipinos and serve as a symbol of patriotism and the pursuit of national freedom.
- From my Grandfather. Rizal was a multilingual person who spoke Tagalog, Spanish, French, German, and English fluently. He effectively communicated his ideas by utilizing his linguistic abilities. That's why he was able to get lots of help abroad due to him being able to communicate easily. 
- From my Grandmother. He was a reformist, not a revolutionary. He believed in the power of education and peaceful reform to bring about change and liberty in the Philippines.
