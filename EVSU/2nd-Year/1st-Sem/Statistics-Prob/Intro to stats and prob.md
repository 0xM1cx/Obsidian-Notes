## Statistics
- It is a collection of methods for planning experiments, **obtaining data**, and then **analyzing**, **interpreting** and *drawing conclusion* based on the data. 

### Terms
- **Data** are the values that the variables can assume.
- **Variable** is a characteristic that is observable or measurable in every unit of universe.
- **Population** is the set of all possible values of a variable.
- **Sample** is a subgroup of a population.

### Classification of Variables
- **Qualitative Variable**. These are words or codes that represent a class or category.
	- express a categorical attribute
		- gender
		- religion
		- marital status
		- highest educational attainment
- **Quantitative Variable**. Number that represent an amount or a count. Numerical data, sizes are meaningful and answer question such as "how many" or "how much". These kinds of variables are classified as:
	- **Discrete Variables**, meaning data that can be counted. 
		- number of days
		- number of siblings 
		- usual daily allowance
	- **Continuous Variables**, it can assume values between any two specific values like 0.5, 1.2, etc. and data can be measured
		- weight
		- height
		- body temperature

### Levels of Measurement
- **Nominal Level**. This is characterized by data that consists of names, labels, or categories only.
	- gender
	- most preferred color
	- civil status
- **Ordinal Level**. This involves data that arranged in some order, but differences between data.
	- happiness index for the day
	- the rankings of tennis player
	- academic excellence awards
- **Interval Level**. This is the same in ordinal level, with an additional property that we can determine meaningful amounts of differences between the data. 
	- body temperature 
	- Intelligence  Quotient
- **Ratio Level**. This is an interval level modified to include the inherent zero starting point. It possesses a meaningful absolute, fixed zero pint and allows all arithmetic operations.
	- number of siblings
	- weight 
	- height

### Four Basic Methods of Sampling
- **Random Sampling**, this is done by using chance or random numbers.
- **Systematic Sampling**, this is done by numbering each subject of the population and then selecting the nth number.
- **Stratified Sampling**, if a population has a distinct groups, it is possible to divide the population into these groups and to draw SRS's from each of the groups. I.e. This is a method of sampling that involves the division of a population into smaller sub-groups known as *strata*
- **Cluster Sampling**, this method uses intact groups called *clusters*. Which you divide a population into clusters and then randomly select some of the clusters as your sample.
