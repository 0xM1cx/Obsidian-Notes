## Chapter 1: Land and People

### The Land
- There were two giants(Amihan and Habagat). Amihan ruled the land in the northeast and Habagat took charge of the one in the southwest. Food became scarce in Amihnan's land that his children and kin went southward to fish in Habagat's realm. Habaga was offended and in his anger, he challenged Amihan to a battle at sea. The two giants and their forces battled at the middle of the sea between their domains. They destroyed each other's ships but these were too huge to completely sink into the depths of the sea. In time, these vessels formed into two masses of land which eventually became the island of Samar and Leyte.

- The Philippine islands were mainly connected as a group of large islands during the **Pleistocene period(2 million to 8,000 years ago)**. Luzon, Leyte, Samar and Mindanao extended as one long island. Panay, Masbate, Negros and Cebu comprised one chunk.
