### Musika
- Ancient Waray songs were chanted by the people while walking home from the woods, planting rice, performing house chores, and traveling at sea. A distinct feature of these songs was the guttural sounds rendered in the manner of trilling birds, which the singers created with imagination and skill. In their musical performances, the Waray used the coriapi, the corlong, flutes made of bagakay, the subing, and the agong.

### Teatro
*During the Pre-colonial times, theater in the Philippines was in the form of [indigenous rituals](http://avhrc-kultura.blogspot.com/2007/07/philippine-traditional-theater-forms.html), verbal jousts or games, or songs and dances to praise gods.* According to early chronicles, pre-historic dramas consisted of three elements â€“ myth, mimesis, and spectacle.

Waray theater has its roots in the animistic rituals which shamans and folk healers performed with the community to commune with or appease spirits that lived on land, air, and water.
