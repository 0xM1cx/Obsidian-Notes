# Problem Solving Strategies
- **Problem** exists when there is a situation you want to resolve but no solution is readily apparent.
- **Problem Solving** is the process by which the unfamiliar situation is resolved. A situation that is a problem to one person may not be a problem to someone else.

## Inductive Reasoning
- It is the process of reaching a general conclusion by examining specific examples. Conclusion formed by **Inductive Reasoning** is often *conjecture*, since it may or may not be correct.

### Counterexample
A statement is a *true statement* provided that it is true in all cases. If you can find one case for which a statement is not true, called a **counterexample**, then the statement is false statement. 


## Deductive Reasoning
- Is the process of reaching a conclusion by applying general assumption, principles, or procedures.
- It is a logical approach where you progress from general ideas to specific conclusions.
- In this reasoning, you often make an argument for a certain idea. You make an inference, or come to a conclusion, by applying different premises.

A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers. The numbers, separated by commas are called the *terms* of the sequence.

- **Kenken** is an arithmetic logic puzzle that was invented by the Japanese mathematics teacher *Tetsuya Miyamoto* in 2004. The noun **"Ken"** has **"KNOWLEDGE"** and **"AWARENESS"** as synonyms. Hence, Kenken translates as **Knowledge Squared** or **Awareness Squared**
  
- EUCLID and PAPPUS were interested in solving mathematical problems, but they were also interested in **HEURISTICS**, the study of the methods and rules of discovery and invention. 

- In the 17th century the mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes published some of his ideas in **RULES FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE MIND** and his better known work **DISCOURSE DE LA METHODE**.
- Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz(1646-1716) planned to write a book on heuristics titled **"ART OF INVENTION"**. Of the problem-solving process he wrote **"NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TO SEE THE SOURCES OF INVENTION WHICH ARE, IN MY OPINION, MORE INTERESTING THAN THE INVENTIONS THEMSELVES"**


# Statistics
- It involves the collection, organization, summarization, presentation, and interpretation of data.
- The branch of statistics that involves the collection, organization, summarization, and presentation of data is called **descriptive statistics**
- The branch that interprets and draws conclusion from the data is called **inferential statistics**
- One of the most basic statistical concepts involves finding **Measures of central tendency** of a set of numerical data. Three Types of averages, known as the **arithmetic mean**, **median** and the **mode**. Each of these averages is a **measure of central tendency** for the numerical data.
- In situations where the entire group is under consideration it is known as a **population**, and any subset of the population is called **sample**

## Measure of Central Tendency

### Arithmetic Mean
- Is the most commonly used **measure of central tendency**
- The mean of *n* numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by *n*

## Median
- The **median** of a ranked/sorted list of *n* numbers is:
	- the middle number if *n* is odd.
	- the mean of the two middle numbers if *n* is even.
## Mode
- The **mode** of a list of numbers is the number that occurs the most frequently. 
- Some list of numbers do not have a mode. For instance, in the list 1, 6, 8, 20, 32, 15, 49 each number occurs exactly once.

## Weighted Mean
A value called the **weighted mean** is often used when some data values are more important than others.

Where ![[Pasted image 20221220190429.png]] is the sum of the products formed by multiplying each number by its assigned weight, and ![[Pasted image 20221220190515.png]] is the sum of all the weights.

---
- Data that has not been organized or manipulated in any manner are called **raw data**. 
- A **Frequency Distribution** which is a table that lists observed events and the frequency of occurrence of each observed event, is often used to organize raw data. 
- The frequency distribution can be used to find the mean of the data in a frequency distribution. The only change is that the weights are replaced with the frequencies.

## Measures of Dispersion
To measure the spread or dispersion of data, we must introduce statistical values known as the **range** and the **standard deviation**.

### Range
The **range** of a set of data values is the difference between the greatest data value and the least data value. R = HV - LV
- The range is a measure that **depends only on the two most extreme values**, and as such it is very sensitive.
### Standard Deviation
A measure of dispersion that is less sensitive to extreme values is the **standard deviation**.
- This makes use of the amount by which each individual data value deviates from the mean.
### Variance
This is also used to measure dispersion. The variance for a given set of data is the square of the standard deviation of the data.

## Measures of Relative Position
The number of standard deviations between a data value and the mean is known as the data value's **z-score** or **standard score**



### Quartiles
The three numbers Q1, Q2, and Q3 that partition a ranked data set into four (approximately) equal groups are called **quartiles** of the data. 

<u>THE MEDIAN PROCEDURE FOR FINDING QUARTILES</u>
1. Rank the data
2. Find the median of the data. This will be Q2.
3. Q1 is the median for the values less than Q2.
4. Q3 is the median for the values greater than Q3


### Percentiles
A value *x* is called the *pth percentile* of a data set provided p% of the data values are less than x. 

<u>PERCENTILE FOR A GIVEN DATA VALUE</u>
Given a set of data and a data value *x*,
