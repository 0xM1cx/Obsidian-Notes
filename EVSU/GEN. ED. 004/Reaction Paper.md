## Reaction Paper
### Part 1: A summary of the work
**_Donald in Mathmagic Land_** is a 1959 American animated-live-action featurette produced by Walt Disney Productions and featuring Donald Duck. The short was directed by Hamilton Luske (with Wolfgang Reitherman, Les Clark, and Joshua Meador as sequence directors) and was released on June 26, 1959. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) at the 32nd Academy Awards, and became a widely viewed educational film in American schools of the 1960s and beyond. This film showed how mathematics is part of everything around us. Even in the little details of our world we can see patterns, and shapes forming. From the shape of the buildings, to the patterns of a peacocks tail. 

- This truly makes the phrase "Mathematics is life" true.

### Part 2: Your reaction to the work
This film reminded me of my childhood, on how I used to watch this kinds of shows and how I would struggle in mathematics because I was too lazy to study. But fortunately, I have strict parents who forced me to study.
