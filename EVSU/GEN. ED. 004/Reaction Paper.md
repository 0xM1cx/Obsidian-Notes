## Reaction Paper

### Part 1: A summary of the work
This film entitled **_Donald in Mathmagic Land_** is a American animated-live-action featurette produced by Walt Disney Productions and featuring Donald Duck. It became a widely viewed educational film in American schools of the 1960s and beyond. In the film Donald learns about mathematics and its use cases while traversing through Mathmagic Land guided by a mysterious narrator. I found Donald's question funny "What is math useful for anyway?" and how mathematics is part of everything around us yet this question is always asked even for experience mathematicians, who are always finding solutions to problems using mathematics. Even in the little details of our world we can see patterns, and shapes forming. From the shape of the buildings, to the patterns of a peacocks tail. Even on the discovery of shapes and new technology which, of course, was because of mathematics. In the film they showed Pythagoras is the father of mathematics and music, it showed that what he discovered, which was the two to one ratio, can be presented as scales.

- This truly makes the phrase "Mathematics is life" true.

### Part 2: Your reaction to the work
This film reminded me of my childhood, on how I used to watch this kinds of shows and how I would struggle in mathematics because I was too lazy to study. But fortunately, I have strict parents who forced me to study.  It was wonderful to see how Walt Disney portrayed mathematics that was relatable, easy to understand and enjoyable to watch, especially for the younger generation.

The Animation is spectacular during its time as well the plot, you can really see why it was used as an educational film. This film really gave students a new perspective of mathematics, not only as a tool for you daily live but also for your imagination and curiosity. Its outstanding to think how old and broad mathematics is; how it came to be and how it became a language of the universe.
