## Instructions
In your own words, state what "self" is for each of the following philosophers

After doing so, explain how your concept of self is compatible with how they conceived of the "self"

>**EXAMPLE**: 1. Socrates - According to Socrates...../ I believe that Both I and Socrates have the same perception about how we perceive about self because....

I view self as a state of consciousness. Being aware of what's happening around oneself as well as one's inner self. Its the ability to think and act rationally given a situation without neglecting the emotional factors that come into play.

1. Socrates - According to Socrates one must know himself to be happy. He stated that one must acknowledge ignorance so as to be able to know hat is lacking and what he needs to know.  I agree with his perspective because a person who truly understands himself will not seek happiness in the same way that others do, but will be content with what he has.

2. Plato - According to Plato the Soul is immortal I believe that Plato and I have the same perception of how we perceive self because I believe that the body is only a temporary suit that God has given us to interact with this world. As a result, when we die, our bodies decompose, freeing the soul.

3. Rene Descartes - According to him the "mind is the real self" which is similar to my view of self. Its our ability to question everything, even ourselves, and to respond to the perceptions around us that makes as conscious.

4. John Locke - He stated that the "self is consciousness" which is what I view self. As being in a conscious state. 

5. David Hume - According to David Hume "The Self is just a bundle of perceptions, like links in a chain". I agree with him in the sense that every action a person takes is influenced by the stimuli he or she receives from their surroundings. For example, if a person is angry, that anger is related to a specific event that he or she has experienced. I believe that these perceptions give us humans the ability to survive in the face of danger, hunger, and so on.

6. Immanuel Kant - According to Immanuel Kant "We all have an inner and an outer self which together form our consciousness". I believe in his view of self because a person grows to experience different perceptions in life his/her personality will be shaped based on those perceptions.'


## Philosophical Perspective of the Self
### What is Philosophy?
- It is about finding answer to serious questions about the world we live:
	- What is morally right and wrong?
	- What is a good life?
	- Does God exist?
	- What is the mind?
- Philosophy allows you to:
	- Justify your opinions
	- Spot a bad argument, no matter what a topic is
	- Explain to people why they are wrong and you are right
	- It basically teaches you to think, and to develop critical thinking

### Pythagoras
- First Person to use the term, *Philosophy*

**Love of Wisdom**
- *Philo* - Greek word for **"love"**.
- *Sophia* - Greek word for **"Wisdom"*.*

### Philosophy and the self
- **Socrates** - *"Know Thyself"*
	- Every individual is dualistic - A view of human beings as constituted of two irreducible elements (such as matter and spirit). The quality or state of being dual or having a dual nature.
	- Composed of body and soul
	- Body
		- Imperfect
		- Impermanent
	- Soul
		- Perfect 
		- Permanent

	**Socrates** is the first thinker to focus on the full power of reason on the human self. *Who we are, who we should be, and who we will become*
	- One must acknowledge ignorance as to be able to know what is lacking and what he needs to know
	- Only through soul-searching can we achieve a happy and meaningful life.
#### Socreate's two dichotomous realms
1. Physical Realm
	- Changeable, transient and imperfect
	- The **body** belongs to this realm
2. Ideal Realm
	- Unchanging, eternal, and immortal
	- The **soul** belongs to this realm

## LESSON 1: SELF-AWARENESS
### Natural Tendencies

Behaviors that feel comfortable, that you do without thinking, that just seem natural, that you resort to when under stress, or that you simply identify as "the way you do things" can all be considered to be **natural tendencies**, or your **personal preferences**.

### Learning to Grow
**Self-awareness** - is just the beginning of a lifetime of growth and learning. Once you understand what you prefer, what is comfortable for you, it is much easier to branch out of your comfort zone to learn new behaviors.

### The process of self-discovery
How do you discover more about your own natural tendencies, or preferences? *Here are some ways you can enhance your self-knowledge*:
- Introspection
- Observation
- Feedback(giving and receiving)
- Assessment Tools

#### Introspection
Your own observations are invaluable sources of information about who you are and what makes you tick. You can pay attention and take note of your own experiences, actions, and reactions.
