In your own words, state what "self" is for each of the following philosophers

After doing so, explain how your concept of self is compatible with how they conceived of the "self"

>**EXAMPLE**: 1. Socrates - According to Socrates...../ I believe that Both I and Socrates have the same perception about how we perceive about self because....

I view self as a state of consciousness. Being aware of what's happening around oneself as well as one's inner self. Its the ability to think and act rationally given a situation without neglecting the emotional factors that come into play.

1. Socrates - According to Socrates one must know himself to be happy. He stated that one must acknowledge ignorance so as to be able to know hat is lacking and what he needs to know.  I agree with his perspective because a person who truly understands himself will not seek happiness in the same way that others do, but will be content with what he has.

2. Plato - According to Plato the Soul is immortal I believe that Plato and I have the same perception of how we perceive self because I believe that the body is only a temporary suit that God has given us to interact with this world. As a result, when we die, our bodies decompose, freeing the soul.

3. Rene Descartes - According to him the "mind is the real self" which is similar to my view of self. Its our ability to question everything, even ourselves, and to respond to the perceptions around us that makes as conscious.

4. John Locke - He stated that the "self is consciousness" which is what I view self. As being in a conscious state. 

5. David Hume - According to David Hume "The Self is just a bundle of perceptions, like links in a chain". I agree with him in the sense that every action a person takes is influenced by the stimuli he or she receives from their surroundings. For example, if a person is angry, that anger is related to a specific event that he or she has experienced. I believe that these perceptions give us humans the ability to survive in the face of danger, hunger, and so on.

6. Immanuel Kant - According to Immanuel Kant "We all have an inner and an outer self which together form our consciousness". I believe in his view of self because a person grows to experience different perceptions in life his/her personality will be shaped based on those perceptions.
