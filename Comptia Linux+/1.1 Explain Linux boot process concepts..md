[The Linux Booting Process - 6 Steps Described in Detail](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-linux-booting-process-6-steps-described-in-detail/)

### GRUB Bootloader

- It is a common bootloader for linux systems. GRUB means **GRand Unified Bootloader**
- The bootloader is the first software that  runs when powering on the device.
- Its function is to boot all necessary programs such as the kernel.
- If a device only has 1 OS then the bootloader will automatically run that. But if the device has multiple OSs or versions of kernels the it will display a screen in which you can pick what type you want to load.
- The latest version of GRUB is GRUB2 and now the older version of GRUB is now called GRUB legacy.
- The command `journalctl -b` displays the previous boot messages.

Linux Boot Process Phases

The /boot/ directory holds the files used to boot the operating system.

## Linux Boot Process Phases

- Bootstrap Phase(usually BIOS) - it is the startup process responsible for initializing system hardware and finding the location of instructions responsible for loading the operating system(bootloader).
    
    The ff. are example of bootstrap methods
    
    1. BIOS(Basic Input/Output System)
    2. UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
    3. PXE(Preboot Execution Environment)
    
    ## Boot Options
    
    ### BIOS
    
    This is a traditional bootstrap program that is stored in flash memory chip on the motherboard. It is powered using the CMOS(Complementary Metal-oxide-semiconductor) battery. BIOS initializes the motherboard POST (power-on self-test). If POST encounters any problems, it will either display an error message onscreen or play a series of beeps.
    
    Once POST is complete, BIOS will look through the list of devices for bootloader code.
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)
    
    The bios searches each of these boot options displayed above and looks for the first sector of their storage to find the Master Boot Record.
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)
    
    The master boot record is divided into three sections. The first 446 bytes of the MBR contain the first stage of the master boot code. The master boot code contains error messages (such as “missing operating system”) and the code required for loading the second stage of the bootloader. The next 64 bytes contain the drive’s partition table, and the last 2 bytes contain a disk signature. The disk signature identifies the device that contains the /boot directory, which contains files required by the boot process. Once BIOS has begun loading the bootloader, control of the boot process is turned over to the bootloader.
    
    ### UEFI
    
    This is the newer version of the of the BIOS which includes a Graphical User Interface. Unlike BIOS which was limited to 16-bit addressing, could only access 1MB of memory, could not boot from drives larger than 2.1TB, and could manage only a limited number of devices. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface is an OS neutral, architecture-independent software interface between firmware and the operating system designed to overcome the limitations of BIOS. One of UEFI’s most
    important features is its ability to execute applications prior to the operating system loading.
    
    Some features of UEFI include the following:
    • It provides a user interface prior to the operating system being available.
    • It operates in 32- or 64-bit mode.
    • It has access to all system memory and devices.
    • It can mount partitions and read some filesystems (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and VFAT).
    • It has network capabilities without the OS being loaded.
    • It can boot drives larger than 2.1TB.
    • You can add applications that can be executed as part of the boot process or from UEFI’s command shell.
    
    ### Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)
    
    is a client-server interface that allows computers in a network to be booted from the server before deploying the obtained [PC image](https://www.manageengine.com/products/os-deployer/os-imaging.html) in local and remote offices, for PXE enabled clients. PXE network boot is performed using client-server protocols like DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and TFTP(Trivial File Transfer Protocol). PXE will be enabled by default on all computers. 
    
    PXE requires the client system have a network card that supports PXE and has PXE
    enabled as a boot device in flash memory.
    
    When power is applied to a PXE client, the enabled NIC card “looks” for a DHCP server by broadcasting a series of DHCP discover packets, which are requests from the client to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. The DHCP automatically assign an IP address to the client and provide the client with the location of one or more TFTP servers. A TFTP server uses the UDP to transfer files from a host to a client.
    
    The DHCP server will also provide the location of the TFTP configuration files on the server. Once the client system knows the location of the TFTP server, it downloads and executes the appropriate boot image from the **pxelinux.cfg** directory.
    
    ### NFS
    
    A **network file system** (NFS) is a type of file system mechanism that enables the storage and retrieval of data from multiple disks and directories across a shared network. A network file system enables local users to access remote data and files in the same way they are accessed locally.
    
    ### ISO
    
    An **ISO image** is a file that contains the contents of an entire CD or DVD. We can use an ISO to distribute a large program such as an operating system or we can access the ISO remotely to install an operating system on a client. Access to the ISO can be made via FTP, HTTP, or NFS servers.
    
    FTP is more efficient in transferring larger files. FTP can transfer data in binary mode (bit by bit) or ASCII, and it uses port 20 for a data connection and port 21 for control information. SFTP, or Secure FTP, connects using SSH on port 22. FTP connections can require a password. HTTP connections are single-direction connections via port 80. Examples of HTTP servers are Apache and Nginx.
    An ISO boot may also be achieved by using a custom GRUB2. The custom GRUB entry would specify the path to the ISO file (mounted as a [loopback device](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=loopback+device&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)) and, if
    necessary, a path to the [vmlinux or vmlinuz](https://www.google.com/search?q=vmlinux+and+vmlinuz&client=opera&hs=0Bl&sxsrf=APq-WBvekB80akeVxCLdDFvu64KY-FdKdQ%3A1647330740179&ei=tEUwYq69CtaO2roPr5eT4Ac&ved=0ahUKEwiu5-Gc0cf2AhVWh1YBHa_LBHwQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=vmlinux+and+vmlinuz&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoECCMQJzoFCAAQkQI6CwgAELEDEIMBEJECOgQIABBDOggIABCABBCxAzoFCAAQgAQ6CAgAELEDEJECOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOg0ILhCxAxDHARDRAxBDOg4ILhCABBDHARDRAxDUAjoLCC4QgAQQxwEQrwE6CggAEIAEEIcCEBQ6BAgAEAo6CAgAEBYQChAeSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUOUMWNwsYPctaAJwAHgAgAHGAYgB3xCSAQQyLjE3mAEAoAEByAEJwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz) (kernel) and [initrd](https://www.google.com/search?q=initrd&client=opera&hs=zXQ&sxsrf=APq-WBubDmJ5zHP8sLCuULnS_gSMHtQQKQ%3A1647330820864&ei=BEYwYtWLNPLh2roPpo--4Ac&ved=0ahUKEwjVnZ7D0cf2AhXysFYBHaaHD3wQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=initrd&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECcyBQgAEJECMgoIABCABBCHAhAUMgoIABCABBCHAhAUMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIHCAAQgAQQCjIFCAAQgAQ6BwgAEEcQsAM6BggAEBYQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFDvBVirDWCPGGgBcAF4AIABdYgBzQKSAQMwLjOYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz) [](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=initrd+or+intitramfs&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)[or intitramfs](https://www.google.com/search?q=initramfs&client=opera&sxsrf=APq-WBv_TrC04joSg9o6j3IqToXdWxZv4A%3A1647331060550&ei=9EYwYqyHIYun2roPmvij2Ac&oq=intitramf&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMYADIECAAQQzIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjIECAAQCjoHCCMQsAMQJzoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoKCAAQ5AIQsAMYAToPCC4Q1AIQyAMQsAMQQxgCOhUILhDHARDRAxDUAhDIAxCwAxBDGAI6BAgjECc6BQgAEIAEOgcIABCxAxAKOggIABCABBCxAzoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6CAguEIAEELEDOgoIABCABBCHAhAUOgUIABCRAjoKCAAQsQMQgwEQCjoHCAAQgAQQCjoKCC4QxwEQrwEQCjoGCAAQBRAeSgQIQRgASgQIRhgBUN0GWIIcYPElaAFwAXgAgAF9iAHFCZIBAzIuOZgBAKABAcgBE8ABAdoBBggBEAEYCdoBBggCEAEYCA&sclient=gws-wiz) files.
    
- Bootloader Phase - Once the bootstrap phase is complete, the bootloader is used to load the linux kernel. Although multiple bootloaders are available, we will confine our discussion to GRUB, or Grand Unified Bootloader, and GRUB2.
    
    ### GRUB
    
    This is a legacy bootloader that is divided into separate chunks called *stage[Stage 1 and stage 1.5 or 2].*
    
    Stage 1 — This stage is located on the MBR and its only real job is to point to the location next stage which is stage 1.5 or 2.
    
    Stage 1.5 — This stage of GRUB is located in the first 30KB of the hard drive immediately after the MBR, but before the first partition. Stage 1.5 contains filesystem drivers. These filesystem drivers may be found in **/boot/grub**.
    
    Stage 2 — This stage of GRUB is stored in a disk partition. Stage 2 presents a text menu on the screen that allows the user to select the kernel image that should be loaded. You can configure GRUB with a default image and a timeout value. If the user doesn’t select an option within the timeout period, the system will automatically boot the default kernel image. A typical GRUB menu is shown in Figure 11-5.
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%203.png)
    
    ### grub.conf
    
    The GRUB menu is configured from the default GRUB configuration file /boot/grub/menu.lst. Some distributions use /boot/grub/grub.conf as the configuration file. The file /boot/grub/grub.conf is linked to /boot/grub/menu.lst. The grub.conf file is divided into two sections: global and title (see Figure 11-6).
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)
    
    ### Global Settings
    
    The global settings defines some operating parameters
    
    Device Names — Grub accesses devices via BIOS. Integers distinguish drives and partitions based on the order that GRUB discovers them on the bus. In GRUB Legacy, device and partition numbering begins at 0. Grub uses the **hd** device type for hard disks because it cannot distinguish the difference between hard disk types like SCSI and IDE.  
    
    The syntax for naming a device is **<device_type><drive_number <partition_number>**. Therefore, **hd0,0 (image above)** represents the first partition on the first hard disk, [/dev/sda1](https://superuser.com/questions/558156/what-does-dev-sda-in-linux-mean).
    
    Default — It refers to the default OS to load when a user doesn’t choose in the boot menu. The 0 specifies the first operating system stanza.
    
    Timeout — Is the time in seconds that the grub will wait for user intervention before it proceeds to the default if the user doesn’t intervene.
    
    Splash Image — This defines the image used in the grub menu. 
    
    Password — This setting(not included in the image above) could contain a plaintext or encrypted password that would be required before editing any GRUB settings or executing any GRUB commands during the boot process.
    
    To place a plaintext password, edit this file and add the global setting **password <space><grub_password>**
    
    To creat an encrypted password, open another terminal and execute the command **grub-md5-crypt** and then enter the password you want to use. You will then be asked to verify the password.
    
    ### Title section/setting
    
    This section defines the files and parameters used to load the operating system. (See image above.)
    
    Title — the title line contains the description of the OS to be booted.
    
    Root — This section specifies the location of the GRUB’s root directory (/boot) for the OS being loaded.
    
    Kernel — Specifies the kernel (vmlinux or vmlinuz) to be load and how to mount the OS’s kernel. Additional kernel parameters may be added to his line.
    
    Initrd — This section contains a filesystem that has the executables and drivers required to boot the kernel and also specifies the initrd file to use.
