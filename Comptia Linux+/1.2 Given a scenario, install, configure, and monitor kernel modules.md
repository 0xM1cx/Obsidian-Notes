## What is a Package Manager?
[**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) => A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, verifying the integrity of installed software, querying install software,  and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent mannner. A packet manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files.

**The Table defins some fo the terms associated with package management.**
| Term           | Definition                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Package        | A package is a group of files like library files or scripts that are used by a package manager to install an application/s.                            |
| Package Group  | A group of individual packages that have a similar purpose.                                                                                            |
| Version Number | Defines the edition of a package. The format is (Edition.Major Change.Minor Change)                                                                    |
| Release Number | Identifies a version released to the public.                                                                                                           |
| Architecture   | Refers to the processors the package will be able to run. Some packages will run on multiple architectures, and others are not architecture dependent. |
| Source Code    | Consists of instructions written in a programming language, which are later translated into object code by a compiler.                                 |
| Repository     | A software repository is a location used by package managers to retrieve stored packages.                                                              |


### Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)
This was originally developed in 1997 to install and upgrade software packages in Red Hat Linux distributions. It also contains facilities to query the package database and verify the integrity of the installed packages.

##### Syntax of RPM package name
+ `<package name>`-`<version_number>`-`<release_number>`.`<architecture>`.rpm
+ `<package name>`-`<version_number>`-`<release number>`.`<distributor_designator>`.rpm
	+ **Example of package: bash-3.2-32.el5**
	+ *Package name* This part identifies the name of the package. E.g. above name of package is bash.
	+ *Version number* This part specifies the version of the software in the package. E.g. above version number 3.2 and this indicates that we are looking at the third edition of the software, which has had 2 major changes.
	+ *Release number* This part of the filename indicates the current release of the software version. E.g. above software release is 32.
	+ *Distribution designator* The distribution designator indicates that the package has been compiled for a specific Linux distribution. In our example, the distribution designator is **el5** (Red Hat Enterprise 5).
	+ *Architecture type* This part of the filename specifies the CPU architecture that the software inside the package will run on.

###### RPM modes
The command syntax for managing rpm packages: 
```rpm <mode> <mode_options> <package_name(s) | <package_filename>```
	The rpm command can specify arguemnts like package name or package filename. The package name is used when referencing the databases in /var/lib/rpm. The package filename is the path to the storage location of the package.
| Mode    | Option          | Description                                                         |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| install | -i | Installs a package file                                      |
| upgrade | -U | Upgrades the OS including the packages and install new ones. |
| erase   | -e   | Removes a package.                                           |
| query   | -q   | Retrives package info from the RPM databse in /var/lib/rpm   |

###### Install Mode Options
To install, erase, update, or freshen a pckage, you must have root privileges. The command `rpm -i <package_name>`
| Option            | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -K or --checksig  | Verifies the package is not corrupted by checking the md4 checksum.                           |
| --force           | Forces the installation of a  package, even if the package is installed on the system.        |
| --nodeps          | Indicates to not check package dependencies.                                                  |
| --test            | Checks for possible installing issues(e.g. dependency issues) without installing the package. |
| --prefix `<path>` | Installs the package in the directory specified by the argument `<path>`.                     |
| -v                | Verbose, prints progress info.                                                                |

###### Upgrading Mode Options
The upgrade option will upgrade current packages and install new OS packages as necessary. When using the -U option, RPM considers the checksum information of the original file, the current file installed, and the new file to be installed.
| Options      | Description                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --oldpackage | Permits a newwer version package to be upgraded with an older version package.|
| --force      | The --force option has the same effect as --oldpackage.                        |
| -F           | The -F (freshen) option will only upgrade installed packages.                                                                               |

> [!NOTE] Note
> The -F option only updates existing packages, and the -U option is used to upgrade existing packages and will install additional packages if necessary.

###### Removing (Erasing) an RPM Package
The erase option removes a package. It is best to use the -vv(verbose debug) option when executing the following command.
`rpm -e <package_name>` - removes a package.
During the package remove, rpm -e
+ Checks to make sure no other package depends on the package to be erased.
+ Determines whether any of the package config files have been modified and saves a copy of any modified files.
+ Determines of a file that's part of the package is required by another package. If it's not, the file is erased.
+ Removes all traces of the package and associated files from the RPM database.
