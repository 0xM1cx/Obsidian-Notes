Okay, I wanna start of by saying that I'm not against being a Filipino, I'm proud of being a fully blooded Filipino. This is just a collection of my unshared thoughts; living in the Philippines all my life and what I've seen Filipinos do.  

In recent years, the Philippines GDP has risen; this is due to the growing number of job opportunities and a large number of young Filipinos now working and can now support their family. So what do I mean by this, Firstly, in the older days, Filipino families tend to have multiple children, from 2-6, heck my grandparents have 8 children and I have 3 siblings. This causes a lot of financial strain in the family, not only do they have to feed them(of course), they can't also focus on their work too much because they need to take care of their children and not a lot of families can afford a "yaya" for their children. This makes me think of the phrase "the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer".


Don't get me wrong, Filipinos are hardworking people, OFWs are the hardest working Filipinos, they go to a foreign country with little to no friends and work hard to provide for their Families back home. But unfortunately, some of the families back home tend reply on their overseas family member(s) due to not having a forced necessity to work hard. 

This circumstance of not being forced to work hard can be seen in the younger generation. Filipino youth have one of the lowest test scores and knowledge base in the world. They spend their time one social media too much and complain how hard academia is without even trying that hard to improve. There are those who claim romanticize academia and not even doing the work. The majority of Filipinos who work hard, are those who are forced to by life. Those who have part-time jobs and school. Those who do extra credit and go much further that what is give. Those are the Filipinos who contribute to this country.

In recent years,

# Random Thoughts

1. Looking at the social status of those in top universities, the majority are from middle to upper class. This is due to the fact that families who have the means, can and do everything so that their children learns in a undisturbed environment, where they can focus and grow properly and much quicker. What I mean by this is that a majority of Filipino Families who have the means, buy their children devices, books, and other materials as well as a good environment for their kids to focus. In contrast to those families who can't fully provide those things.  
2. The Filipino mindset, we have this mindset of nature will take its course or "bahala na"
