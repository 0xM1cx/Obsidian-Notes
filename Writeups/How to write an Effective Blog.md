- Short vs. long form-blog posts

### Introduction
- Start with either a quick summary of what you're about to talk about or an anecdote. This is the hook! Identify key need/problem that you will solve.

### Middle
- Provide details and main content in short paragraphs, list, and, divide up key points with motivating headers.

### End
- Make you final point and include a call-to-action of some kind.
