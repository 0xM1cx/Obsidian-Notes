#### **Recommendations**

 Based on the information acquired throughout the whole duration of the study, the researchers recommend that further development of the product to achieve a better version compare to its current state.

 The future development of the product should focus on the implementation of the omnidirectional display interface to provide the user an easy access to the product’s display. Also, one must consider increasing the range of the product in order for the user to be able to use it in a more spacious areas.

#### Conclusion
The study shows that the researcher’s product is sufficient enough to be considered as energy efficient; and the safety of using the researcher's product; and the effectiveness of the researcher’s product in terms of distance and response time. Thus, the I.R. Remote operated wireless Arduino controlled extension wire has a positive effect on people who often forget to unplug electronic devices or appliances.
#### **Recommendations**

Based on the information gathered throughout the course of the study, the researchers recommend that the product be further developed in order to achieve a better version than its current state.

The product's future development should focus on the implementation of an omnidirectional display interface to provide the user with easy access to the product's display. Also, one must consider increasing the product's range so that the user can use it in more spacious areas. 
Furthermore, implementing additional features such as mobile notification, preference saving wherein the user can set and save a pre-specified time or list of pre-specified time for them to no longer manully input the time each use, and image recognition for the device to intelligently detect if the user is sleeping or has left for a variable amount of time.
