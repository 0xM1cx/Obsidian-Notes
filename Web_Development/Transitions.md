## What is CSS transition?
CSS offers the `transition` property which is used to change the state of an element smoothly.

This is good because instead of changing the style state of an element suddenly like on `hover`, we can change the state of the HTML element smoothly, in the form of transition animation.

To implement the `transition` effect on HTML elements, we need to specify two things:
- the property on which you want to add the transition effect.
- the duration of the effect.

> **NOTE:** If we don't specify the duration time, then the transition will not happen, or it will happen but we won't be able to see it because it will happen instantaneously, as the **default duration time**
