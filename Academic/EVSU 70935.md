***5. What subject in high school did you find most challenging?***

I would say during the pandemic the subject I’ve struggled the most was my Physics subject because my subject teacher at that time wasn’t really active in online classes and I think that fact that were learning from home makes it difficult because it’s hard to grasp physics concepts without seeing it in action through labs.

Overall the education system in which you strive to become a leading state university in technological and professional education is what led my to choose your college.

***8. What is your favorite book and why?***

My favorite book is actually the first book I’ve read when I started getting into IT, which is **Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming.** This book made me realize the importance of technology and how programming can help in our daily lives not just by making tools and automating our tasks but also making project that can help our community. Its the book that led to into the rabbit hole as they would say it.

Yes, when I was in my 10th grade I was a platoon leader and tasked in handling 13 students.
