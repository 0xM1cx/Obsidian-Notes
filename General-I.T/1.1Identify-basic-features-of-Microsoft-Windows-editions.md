## Understanding Operating Systems
The **OS** provides a consistent environment for other software to execute commands. The OS provides users with the interface with the computer so that they can send command(inputs) and receive feedback or results(outputs). In order for the OS to accomplish this it must communicate with the devices hardware, for it to perform the following tasks:
- Disk Storage and file management
- Device access
- Memory management
- Output formatting

**Drivers** are specific software written for the purpose of instruction a particular OS on how to access a piece of hardware. Each router, modem or printer has unique features and configuration settings, and the driver allows the OS to understand how the hardware works and what it is able to do.

## Windows 10 editions
Windows 10 has 15 editions released, 5 of which have been discontinued(<i>Win 10 Mobile, Win 10 Mobile Enterprise, IoT Mobile, Win 10 S and Win 10X</i>).

### Win 10 Home
It's sold as a retail product and is preinstalled by the hardware vendor. When the OS is preinstalled, it is referred to as an **original equipment manufacturer(OEM)** operating system. This edition also lacks the key feature of joining a domain that can only be found in Win 10 Pro or Enterprise.

### Win 10 Pro
This is the premier retail edition of Win 10 OS. It is the most common OEM OS because it enables users to join corporate domains and because value-added for the hardware vendor.

### Win 10 Pro for Workstations
This edition is used primarily for high-end computer workstations that require more than two CPUs and that need to address more than 2 TB of memory. This edition supports up to 4 CPUs and 6 TB of memory. Additionally, it supports Remote Direct Memory Access and Non-Volatile Dual Inline Memory Modules(NVDIMM).

### Win 10 Enterprise
This edition supports all features of Win 10 Pro and can be found in mid-to-large sized organizations because it supports features for these sized organizations. This edition can only be purchased with a volume license subscription from Microsoft. 

## Feature differences
### Domain access vs. workgroup
### Desktop styles/user interface
### Availability of RDP
**Remote Desktop** is a client and server application that uses RDP to allow a client to view the desktop of a remote server or workstation. It uses RDP to facilitate the remote session. 

All Win 10/11 OSs can act as clients to a Remote Desktop server. However, Win 10/11 Home cannot act as a server for a Remote Desktop client.
### RAM support limitations
### BitLocker
It enables the use of drive encryption to protect files, including those needed for startup and login. This feature is available in all editions of Windows 10/11, except for Windows 10/11 Home. For  removable drives, it provides the same encryption technology to help prevent unauthorized access to the files stored on them.

It is a volume-level encryption method that uses a cryptographic key pair that is stored in the Trusted Platform Module(TPM)
