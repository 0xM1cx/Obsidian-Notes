## Understanding Operating Systems
The **OS** provides a consistent environment for other software to execute commands. The OS provides users with the interface with the computer so that they can send command(inputs) and receive feedback or results(outputs). In order for the OS to accomplish this it must communicate with the devices hardware, for it to perform the following tasks:
- Disk Storage and file management
- Device access
- Memory management
- Output formatting

### Operating System Terms and Concepts
**Drivers** are specific software written for the purpose of instruction a particular OS on how to access a piece of hardware. Each router, modem or printer has unique features and configuration settings, and the driver allows the OS to understand how the hardware works and what it is able to do.

**Shell** is a program that runs on top of the OS and allows the user to issue commands through a set of menus or another interface(which may or not be graphical). Shells make an OS easier to use by changing the user interface. Explorer is the name of the shell that has been used with the windows OS since Win 95.

**Cooperative Multitasking**. The application or task is in control of the CPU until it is finished with processing. If any application is locked up while using the processor, the application was unable to free the processor to do other tasks and the entire system locked, usually forcing a reboot.

**Preemptive Multitasking** is a multitasking method in which the OS allots each application a certain amount of processor time and then forcibly takes back control and gives another application or task access to the processor. So if the application crashes, the OS can take back control of the processor and pass it to the next application.

**Multithreading** is the ability of a single application to have multiple requests in to the processor at one time. This results in faster application performance because it allows a program to do many things at once.

**32-Bit**. A <i>32-bit OS</i> is one that can only run on a 32-bit processor but can utilize the capabilities of the processor fully. While this may sound simple, the truth of the matter is that it took many years after the 32-bit processor became available.  You cannot execute 64-bit software on 32-bit OS; the instructions sets are functionally different.
**64-Bit OS** is one that is written to utilize the instructions possible with 64-bit processors. Originally, these were more common with servers than desktops, but they have now become ubiquitous in the market with both **Intel** and **AMD(Advanced Mirco Devices, Inc)** processors.

> **Difference between a 32-bit and 64-bit CPU**
> A a big difference between the 2 is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks.
> 
> 64-bit processors com in dual-core, quad-core, six-core, and eight-core versions for home computing. Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which increases the processing power and helps makes a computer run faster. 
> 
> Another big difference  is the maximum amount of memory(RAM) that is supported. 32-bit computers support a maximum of 4 GB(2^32 bytes) of memory, whereas 64-bit CPUs can address a theoretical maximum of 18 EB (2^64 bytes). However, the practical limit of 64-bit CPU (as of 2018) is 8 TB of addressable RAM.

## Windows 10 editions
Windows 10 has 15 editions released, 5 of which have been discontinued(<i>Win 10 Mobile, Win 10 Mobile Enterprise, IoT Mobile, Win 10 S and Win 10X</i>).

### Win 10 Home
It's sold as a retail product and is preinstalled by the hardware vendor. When the OS is preinstalled, it is referred to as an **original equipment manufacturer(OEM)** operating system. This edition also lacks the key feature of joining a domain that can only be found in Win 10 Pro or Enterprise.

### Win 10 Pro
This is the premier retail edition of Win 10 OS. It is the most common OEM OS because it enables users to join corporate domains and because value-added for the hardware vendor.

### Win 10 Pro for Workstations
This edition is used primarily for high-end computer workstations that require more than two CPUs and that need to address more than 2 TB of memory. This edition supports up to 4 CPUs and 6 TB of memory. Additionally, it supports Remote Direct Memory Access and Non-Volatile Dual Inline Memory Modules(NVDIMM).

### Win 10 Enterprise
This edition supports all features of Win 10 Pro and can be found in mid-to-large sized organizations because it supports features for these sized organizations. This edition can only be purchased with a volume license subscription from Microsoft. 

## Feature differences
### Domain access vs. workgroup
### Desktop styles/user interface
### Availability of RDP
**Remote Desktop** is a client and server application that uses RDP to allow a client to view the desktop of a remote server or workstation. It uses RDP to facilitate the remote session. 

All Win 10/11 OSs can act as clients to a Remote Desktop server. However, Win 10/11 Home cannot act as a server for a Remote Desktop client.
### RAM support limitations
### BitLocker
It enables the use of drive encryption to protect files, including those needed for startup and login. This feature is available in all editions of Windows 10/11, except for Windows 10/11 Home. For  removable drives, it provides the same encryption technology to help prevent unauthorized access to the files stored on them.

It is a volume-level encryption method that uses a cryptographic key pair that is stored in the Trusted Platform Module(TPM)
