## Rules for Naming Variables 
We know how to create variables, using the `var` and `let` keyword, naming the variable and assigning it a value. 

### Naming Convention
Given below are few general rules for naming a variable in JavaScript:

-   A variable name cannot start with a number. For example, `var 1n;` will lead to error.
-   JavaScript keywords cannot be used as the name of the variable. For example, `var new = 5;` will lead to an error, because `new` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
-   JavaScript is case-sensitive in nature. For example, `age=15;` and `AGE=15;` both are different variables.
-   The name of the variable must start either with a letter or an **underscore** `_`, or with a **dollar sign** `$`.

## Data types in JS
When we create a variable in JS, we create it to assign some value. The value that is assigned to a variable or the value that is stored in the variable is some data, which is of some type, it can be a number, a text, etc. this is know as **Datatype**

In JavaScript, we have some standard pre-defined datatypes. There are **seven types** of data types that can be divided into two main categories, which are given below:
-   Primitive
-   Non-primitive
