## Introduction
- **Stocks/Shares/Equities** - These are portions of a company. 

### 2 Types of Stocks
1. **Common Stock** - You get voting rights if you have enough stocks of it. Common stockholders are last in line when it comes to company assets, which means they will be paid out after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders.
2. **Preferred Stock** - These kinds of stocks are priority for dividends. Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.

### Why do companies sell their stocks
They sell their stock to gain additional capital for their business operations, such as Research and Development. 

> OWN WORDS:
### How can you earn through stocks?
1. **Through dividends**, this happens when companies have excess capital and they would like to give some of it to their shareholders. The priority to be given would be the preferred shareholders, creditors and bondholders. Last on that list would be the  common stockholder. 
2. **Through capital gains**, this is the increase of an assets value relative to the price that was originally paid for it. Let's say you but a 5 shares, each share is 100 pesos, then the 5 shares are worth 500 pesos. Overtime, the value of the share increased form 100 to 110 so the  5 shares you owned are now worth 550 pesos aggregately.
