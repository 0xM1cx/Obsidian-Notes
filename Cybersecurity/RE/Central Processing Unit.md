## Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
The **instruction cycle** is the cycle that the CPU follows from boot-up until the computer has shut down in order to process instructions. It is composed of three main stages: the fetch stage, the decode stage, and the execute stage.

### Role of Components
- **Program Counter(PC)** - this is a special register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. Gets incremented after each instruction fetch.
- **Instruction Register(IR)** - Holds the current fetched instruction for decoding and execution
- **Control Unit** - Coordinates and manages the execution of instruction. Controls the flow of data between the CPU and other components.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)** - Performs arithmetic and logical operations as directed by the executed instruction.
- **Registers** - Temporary storage locations used for holding during the execution of instructions. Examples include the accumulator, data registers, and address registers
- **Memory** - Stores both data and instructions that the CPU uses during execution.
