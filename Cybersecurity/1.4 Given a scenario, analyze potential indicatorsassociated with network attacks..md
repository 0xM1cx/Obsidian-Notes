# Network Attack Indicator

## Wireless
Wireless technology is very common networking technology that has substantial number of standards and processes to connect users to network via a radio signal, thus freeing machines from wires. As in all software systems, wireless networkig is a target for hackers.This is partly because of the simple fact that wireless removes the physical barrier.
#### Evil Twin
An **Evil Twin** attack is a spoofing cyberattack that works by tricking users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an "evil twin" network, hackers can access everything from their network traffic to private login credentials. 

This attack uses an AP owned by an attacker that usually has been enhanced with higher-power and higher-gain antennas to look like a better connection to the users attaching to it.

This can give an attacker an opportunity to perfom man in the middle attacks. An attacker can also perfom DOS by jamming the wireless signal, not allowing any computer to connect to the access point successfully.

#### Rogue access point
A rougue access point is a device not sanctioned by an administrator, but is operating on the network anyway. This could be an access point set up by either an employee or by an intruder. The AP could also belong to a nearby company.

By setting up a **rogue access point**, an attacker can attempt to get clients to connet to it  as if it were authorized and  then simply authenticate to the real AP.
