The first step in a digital forensic investigation is to create a forensic image, which we will refer to as imaging. **Disk imaging** is a special method of copying. You will understand everything about imaging in the Evidence AcquisitionÂ course. But for now, all you need to know is that when you create a disk image, you can either create an image of the whole physical drive or an image of a part within the drive. So how disks are partitioned?

Mostly, hard disk drives come with a free unallocated space without partitions, but a hard disk may be logically split into smaller disks, called partitions. Each of these partitions is treated as a separate disk, which allows storing different operating systems on the same hard disk.

Hard drives with DOS partitioning allocates the first sector of the disk, 512 bytes, for the Master Boot Record (MBR). Commonly, the MBR contains a set of commands that are required for booting the operating system. It also contains a partition table that keeps the information about the size and location of logical partitions and available file systems. The disk can be partitioned into a maximum number of four partitions, called primary partitions. However, if more than four partitions are needed, extended partitions can be used.

The logical drive is the disk part that interacts with the user and has a name, file system, and size. You create different logical drives with different sizes, however, they all will remain part of the same physical disk. Each logical drive can have its own file system.

**Volume**. Is a set of addressable sectors used by an Operating system or application to store data. The sectors that form a volume do not have to be physically consecutive, however, for an operating system or application, they will give an impression that they are. An example of a volume is the hard disk, which constitutes a consecutive set of sectors. Merging smaller volumes would also create a volume. Meanwhile, a volume can contain two or more physical drives. Another important concept, which is usually confused with volume, is the partition. The partition is a set of consecutive sectors in a volume, based on this definition; a partition is actually a volume.

#### Virtual Hard Disk
**VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)** is a file format representing a virtual hard disk drive (HDD). VHDs may contain what is found on a physical HDD, such as disk partitions and a file system, which means they can also contain files (images, documents, programs, etc) and directories/folders. They are usually used as the hard disk of a virtual machine, but in most of our courses, we will be using them for exercises. VHDs are also the native file format for Microsoft's hypervisor, also known as Hyper-V. Another VHD format that you might encounter is the VHDx, more on that in later courses. VHD has the **.vhd** file extension, while VHDx has the **.vhdx** file extension.
