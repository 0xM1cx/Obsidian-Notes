# Monthly Topic Focus
> The Goal of this sections is to organize what topics to focus for each month, to learn as much TTPs and Tools for each month. This doesn't mean that I won't be learning another stuff, it only indicates that I will focus on a specific topic as a goal per day and if I have time, learn some other stuff as well. This is in preparation for next year's Hack4Gov Capture the Flag

My Focus Areas: **Web Exploitation**, **Digital Forensics**, **Stego**, **Cryptography**, **Pwning**

- [ ] November - Web Application Security
- [ ] December - Digital Forensics, Steganography, OSINT
- [ ] January -  Cryptography, Network Security
- [ ] February - Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation
- [ ] March - Pwn(Own), Attacking Machines
- [ ] April - Security Analyst, Security+
- [ ] May - Blue Team Operations, Incident Handling, Threat Intelligence & Hunting
- [ ] June - Cyberdefenders, Blueteamlabs, pentester lab, tryhackme, hackthebox practice
