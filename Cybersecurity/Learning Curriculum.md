## Monthly Topic Focus
> The Goal of this sections is to organize what topics to focus for each month, to learn as much TTPs and Tools for each month. This doesn't mean that I won't be learning another stuff, it only indicates that I will focus on a specific topic as a goal per day and if I have time, learn some other stuff as well. This is in preparation for next year's Hack4Gov Capture the Flag
