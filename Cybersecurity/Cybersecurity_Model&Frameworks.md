## Diamond Model
The **Diamond Model** is a model for mapping adversary activity. It's useful for many aspects of InfoSec, including CTI.

This model of intrusion analysis explains how an **adversary** exploits a **capability** of an **infrastructure** against a **victim**. This approach claims that adversaries use their infrastructure capabilities against victims to make an impact on each intrusion.

---
This model is named because of the shape formed by the relationships between the 4 core features of an intrusion event:

- Adversary: intruder/attack.
- Capabilities: adversary's tools and/or techniques.
- Infrastructure: physical and/or logical resources used by adversary.
- Victim: organization or system hit by adversary.
