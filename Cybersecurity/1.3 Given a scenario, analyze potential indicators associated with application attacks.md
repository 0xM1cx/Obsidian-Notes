#### Privilege Escalation

> **Own Explanation
> Privilege escalation is act of gaining privilege that a user or attacker is not entitled to have.

**Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an OS or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.
This has 2 forms:
1. ***Vertical Privilege Escalation***,  also known as _privilege elevation_, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (e.g. Internet Banking users can access site administrative functions or the password for a smartphone can be bypassed.)

2. ***Horizontal Privilege Escalation*** is where a normal user accesses function or content reserved for other normal users (e.g. Internet Banking User A accesses the internet bank account of User B)

#### Cross-site Scripting 
**Cross-site scripting**, or XSS, is one of the most common web attack methodologies. The cause of the vulnerability is weak user input validation. If input is not validated properly, an attacker can include a script in their input and have it rendered as part of the web process.

**Types of XSS attacks**

***Non-persistent XSS attack*** Non-persistent XSS attack The injected script is not persisted or stored but rather is immediately executed and passed back via the web server. 
***Persistent XSS attack*** The script is permanently stored on the web server or some back-end storage. This allows the script to be used against others who log in to the system. 
***DOM-based XSS attack*** The script is executed in the browser via the Document Object Model (DOM) process

#### Injection Attacks
User input without input validation results in an opportunity for an attacker to craft input to create specific events that occur when the input is parsed and used by an application. Command injection attacks can occur when input is used in a fashion that allows command-line manipulation. This can give an attacker command-list access at the privilege level of the application.

**Sql Injections** -->  A SQL injection attack is a form of code injection aimed at any SQL-based database. E.g. `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;`. The SQL example is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since `OR 1=1` is always TRUE.

**DLL** --> It is  a peice of code that can add functionality to a program through the inclusion of library routines linked at runtime. It is the process of adding to a program, at runtime, a DLL that has specific function vulnerability that can be capitalized upon by attackers.

A good example of this is MS Office, a suite of programs that use DLLS loaded at runtime. Adding an _evil_ DLL in the correct directory, or via registry key, can result additional functionality being incurred.

**LDAP** --> LDAP-based systems are also subject to injection attacks. When an application constructs an LDAP request based on user input, a failure to validate the input can lead to a bad LDAP request. Just as SQL injection can be used to execute arbitrary commands in a database, LDAP injection can do the same in a directory system. Something as simple as a wildcard character **_(*)_** in a search box can return results that would normally be beyond the scope of a query. Proper input validation is important before a request is passed to an LDAP engine.

**XML** --> XML injections can be used to manipulate an XML-based system. Because XML is nearly ubiquitous in web applications, this form of attack has a wide range or targets. XML that is maliciously altered can affect changes in configurations, changes in data streams, changes in outputs all from the injection.
