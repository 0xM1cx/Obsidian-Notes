#### Privilege Escalation

> **Own Explanation
> Privilege escalation is act of gaining privilege that are not entitle to have.

**Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an OS or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.
This has 2 forms:
1. ***Vertical Privilege Escalation***,  also known as _privilege elevation_, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (e.g. Internet Banking users can access site administrative functions or the password for a smartphone can be bypassed.)

2. ***Horizontal Privilege Escalation*** is where a normal user accesses function or content reserved for other normal users (e.g. Internet Banking User A accesses the internet bank account of User B)

#### Cross-site Scripting 
**Cross-site scripting**, or XSS, is one of the most common web attack methodologies. The cause of the vulnerability is weak user input validation. If input is not validated properly, an attacker can include a script in their input and have it rendered as part of the web process.

**Types of XSS attacks**

***Non-persistent XSS attack*** Non-persistent XSS attack The injected script is not persisted or stored but rather is immediately executed and passed back via the web server. 
***Persistent XSS attack*** The script is permanently stored on the web server or some back-end storage. This allows the script to be used against others who log in to the system. 
***DOM-based XSS attack*** The script is executed in the browser via the Document Object Model (DOM) process

#### Injection Attacks
User input without input validation results in an opportunity for an attacker to craft input to create specific events that occur when the input is parsed and used by an application. Command injection attacks can occur when input is used in a fashion that allows command-line manipulation. This can give an attacker command-list access at the privilege level of the application.

**Sql Injections** -->  A SQL injection attack is a form of code injection aimed at any SQL-based database. E.g. `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;`. The SQL example is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since `OR 1=1` is always TRUE.
