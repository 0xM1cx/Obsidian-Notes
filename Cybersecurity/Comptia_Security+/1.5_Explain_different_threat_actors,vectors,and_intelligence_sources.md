## Actors and threats
**Threats** are actions that can results in a risk to a system. A **Threat Actor** is the source of the threat on the system. Deliberately accessing computer  systems and networks without authorization is generally referred as *hacking* and the individuals who conduct this activity are called *hackers*.

### Advanced persistent threat (APT)
These are adversaries that posses a sophisticated level of expertise and significant resource which allow it to create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors like cyber, physical, and deception.

### Insider Threats
This is a threat or a security risk that originates from within the targeted organization. It is usually a current or former employee or business associate who has access to sensitive information or privileged accounts within the network of an organization and misuses this access.

**Types of Insider Threats**
- **Malicious insider**. also known as *Turncloak*, someone who maliciously and intentionally abuses legitimate credentials.
- **Careless insider**. an innocent pawn who unknowingly exposes the system to outside threats.
- **A mole**. an imposter who is technically an outsider but has managed to gain insider access to a privileged network. This is someone from outside the organization who poses as an employee or partner.

### State actors
These  are elite hackers that are state sponsored. They are capable of writing scripts that exploit vulnerabilities but are also capable of discovering new vulnerabilities.

State actors are employed by governments to compromise or gain access to the intelligence data of targeted governments. Some are employed in major cybersecurity firms in an effort to combat criminal activity.

### Hacktivists
**Hacktivism** is the act of hacking, or breaking into a computer system, for politically or socially motivated purposes. The individual who performs this act is called a **Hacktavist.**

Hacktivist groups may include script kiddies, but in general script kiddies do not have the skills to participate in a meaningful manner in advancing a hacktivist cause, although they may be enlisted as ground troops to add volume to an attack.
