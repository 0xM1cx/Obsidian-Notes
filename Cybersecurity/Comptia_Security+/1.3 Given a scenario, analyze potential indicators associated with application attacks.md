## Privilege Escalation
---
> **Own Explanation**
> Privilege escalation is act of gaining privilege that a user or attacker is not entitled to have.

**Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an OS or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.
This has 2 forms:
1. ***Vertical Privilege Escalation***,  also known as _privilege elevation_, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (e.g. Internet Banking users can access site administrative functions or the password for a smartphone can be bypassed.)

2. ***Horizontal Privilege Escalation*** is where a normal user accesses function or content reserved for other normal users (e.g. Internet Banking User A accesses the internet bank account of User B)
### Mitigation
-   Path quickly: When it comes to OS-level privilege escalation vulnerabilities, it is vital to install security patches as soon as possible, not only for the OS, but for all third-party applications used on the system.
-   Update anti-virus/anti-malware software to block known vulnerabilities.
-   Data execution prevention: Application whitelisting technologies can be used to restrict which programs may run on a system or limited the areas where data can be executable, enabling organizations to reduce a machine's attack surface. Making sure that unneeded services are turned off and that unused hardware components and drivers are disabled is also very important.    
-   Address space layout randomization: Some operative system allow the data to be allocated randomly preventing a buffer overrun at a known memory address.


## Cross-site Scripting
----
**Cross-site scripting**, or XSS, is one of the most common web attack methodologies. The cause of the vulnerability is weak user input validation. If input is not validated properly, an attacker can include a script in their input and have it rendered as part of the web process.

### Types of XSS attacks

***Non-persistent(Reflected) XSS attack*** Non-persistent XSS attack The injected script is not persisted or stored but rather is immediately executed and passed back via the web server. 
***Persistent(Stored) XSS attack*** The script is permanently stored on the web server or some back-end storage. This allows the script to be used against others who log in to the system. 
***DOM-based XSS attack*** The script is executed in the browser via the Document Object Model (DOM) process

### Protecting against
***From a users perspective some actions or precautions can be taken:***
-   Be careful when clicking untrusted links.
-   Consider disabling JS or limit its use.
-   Keep your browser and applications updated.

***From a developer point of view:***
-   Train and maintain awareness.
-   Do not trust any user input.
-   Use escaping/encoding.
-   Sanitize HTML.
-   Set the Http-Only flag.
-   Use a Content Security Policy.
-   Scan regularly.

## Injection Attacks
---
User input without input validation results in an opportunity for an attacker to craft input to create specific events that occur when the input is parsed and used by an application. Command injection attacks can occur when input is used in a fashion that allows command-line manipulation. This can give an attacker command-list access at the privilege level of the application.

**Sql Injections** -->  A SQL injection attack is a form of code injection aimed at any SQL-based database. E.g. `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;`. The SQL example is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since `OR 1=1` is always TRUE.

**DLL** --> It is  a piece of code that can add functionality to a program through the inclusion of library routines linked at runtime. It is the process of adding to a program, at runtime, a DLL that has specific function vulnerability that can be capitalized upon by attackers.

A good example of this is MS Office, a suite of programs that use DLLS loaded at runtime. Adding an _evil_ DLL in the correct directory, or via registry key, can result additional functionality being incurred.

**LDAP** --> LDAP-based systems are also subject to injection attacks. When an application constructs an LDAP request based on user input, a failure to validate the input can lead to a bad LDAP request. Just as SQL injection can be used to execute arbitrary commands in a database, LDAP injection can do the same in a directory system. Something as simple as a wildcard character **_(*)_** in a search box can return results that would normally be beyond the scope of a query. Proper input validation is important before a request is passed to an LDAP engine.

**XML** --> XML injections can be used to manipulate an XML-based system. Because XML is nearly ubiquitous in web applications, this form of attack has a wide range or targets. XML that is maliciously altered can affect changes in configurations, changes in data streams, changes in outputs all from the injection.


## Pointer/Object Dereference
----
[Do more research on this kind of attack.]
Some computer languages use a construct referred to as a pointer, a construct that refers to the memory location that  
holds the variable, as opposed to a variable, where the  
value is stored directly in the memory location.

A null-pointer dereference takes place when a pointer with a value of NULL is used as though it pointed to a valid memory area.

Null-pointer dereferences, while common, can generally be found and corrected in a simple way. They will always result in the crash of the process, unless exception handling (on some platforms) is invoked, and even then, little can be done to salvage the process.


## Directory Traversal
---
Directory traversal or Path Traversal is an HTTP attack which allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server’s root directory.

Web servers provide two main levels of security mechanisms:
-   Access Control Lists (ACLs)
-   Root directory

The **root directory** is a specific directory on the server file system in which the users are confined. Users should not able to access anything above this root but, if not properly configured or vulnerable, attackers can explore the rest of the disc.
An **Access Control List** is used in the authorization process. It is a list which the web server’s administrator uses to indicate which users or groups are able to access, modify or execute particular files on the server, as well as other access rights.


## Buffer Overflow
---
Buffers are memory storage regions that temporarily hold data while it is being transferred from one location to another. A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations.
##### Types of buffer overflow attacks
-   **Stack-based buffer overflows**: Stack-based buffer overflows are more common, and leverage stack memory that only exists during the execution time of a function. The stack holds data in a last-in, first-out structure.
-   **Heap-based attacks**: Heap-based attacks are harder to carry out and involve flooding the memory space allocated for a program beyond memory used for current runtime operations.


## Race Condition
---
A race condition is an error condition that occurs when the output of a function is dependent on the sequence or timing of the inputs. It is the condition of an electronics, software, or other system where the system's substantive behavior is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when one or more of the possible behaviors is undesirable.

_**Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use**_ (TOCTOU) attacks fall under the category of a race condition which, as said, occurs when two or more operations that should be done in sequence are attempted simultaneously. Attackers are able to access a file and make harmful changes between the time of check (first time the program accesses the file) and the time of use (when the software uses the file). The opportunity window is very short due to that near simultaneous overlap.


## Improper Error Handling
---
Improper handling of errors can introduce a variety of security problems for a web site. The most common problem is when detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to the user (attacker). 

These messages reveal implementation details that should never be revealed. Such details can provide attackers important clues on potential flaws in the site and such messages are also disturbing to normal users.


## Improper Input Handling
---
Improper input handling is the term used to describe functions such as validation, sanitization, filtering, or encoding and/or decoding of input data. Improper Input handling is a leading cause of critical vulnerabilities that exist in today's systems and applications. No input should never be trusted.


## Replay Attacks
---
A replay attack occurs when a cybercriminal eavesdrops on a secure network communication, intercepts it, and then fraudulently delays or resends it to misdirect the receiver into doing what the hacker wants. The added danger of replay attacks is that a hacker does not even need advanced skills to decrypt a message after capturing it from the network. The attack could be successful simply by resending the whole thing.

**Types of replay Attacks**
-   **Pass-the-hash**: A Pass-the-hash (PtH) attack is a technique whereby an attacker captures a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and then simply passes it through for authentication and potentially lateral access to other networked systems. The threat actor doesn’t need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plain text password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the passwords hash remains static for every session until the password is rotated. Attackers commonly obtain hashes by scraping a system’s active memory and other techniques.

-   **Session replays**: Session replay attacks are network attacks that maliciously focus on the user's session IDs stored as either a cookie, URL, or form field. This makes possible the _**session hijacking**_. Session hijacking happens when an intruder takes advantage of a compromised active session by hijacking or stealing the HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on most websites. Another way is by predicting an active session to gain unauthorized access to information in a remote webserver without detection as the intruder uses the credentials of the particular user.


## Integer Overflow
---
An integer overflow is a programming error condition that   occurs when a program attempts to store a numeric value, which is an integer, in a variable that is too small to hold it.

Integer overflow are dangerous because it can often lead to buffer overflows.


## Request Forgery
----
Request forgery is a class of attack where a user performs a  
state-changing action on behalf of another user, typically  
without their knowledge.

### Two Types of request forgeries

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

**Server-Side Request Forgery**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks are designed to exploit how a server processes external information. Some web applications may be designed to read information from or write information to a particular URL like a REST API. If an attacker can modify the target URL, they can potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the application or inject untrusted input into it.


## API Attacks
---
An API attack is an abusive or manipulative usage or attempted usage of an API, commonly used to breach data or manipulate a commerce solution.

**Resource Exhaustion**
Resource exhaustion attacks are computer security exploits that crash, hang, or otherwise interfere with the targeted program or system.

**Dos/DDoS Attacks**
In a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, the attacker attempts to make the targeted system unavailable to its intended users. They have a wide variation of possible scale. At one extreme, "slow" DoS attacks can exhaust the victim’s resources with very little bandwidth. At the opposite extreme, volumetric DDoS assaults can consist of several terabits per second of incoming traffic. When these occur against prominent websites, they can gain a lot of publicity. However, DoS and DDoS attacks are growing in frequency against API endpoints as well.

**DHCP Starvation**
A DHCP starvation attack is an that targets DHCP servers. During a DHCP attack, a hostile actor floods a DHCP server with bogus DISCOVER packets until the DHCP server exhausts its supply of IP addresses. Once that happens, the attacker can deny legitimate network users service, or even supply an alternate DHCP connection that leads to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

**Zip bomb**
It is a relatively small file that when extracted consumes a huge amount of memory.

**Data Exposure**
Web applications frequently process and transfer sensitive data: ***credit card information***, ***passwords***, ***session tokens***, ***private health information***, and more. If an application does not handle the data correctly—for example, by not encrypting in transit, or at rest—then it could be compromised.

This is especially a concern for RESTful APIs that use HTTP as the underlying protocol. HTTP includes a number of operations that are potentially vulnerable. An attacker can craft malicious requests, control message mapping, and even manipulate the responses generated by the backend system.

**Parameter Tampering**
An attacker attempts to manipulate the parameters exchanged between client and server. The goal is to modify application data, such as user credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc.

## Memory Vulnerabilities
---
1. **Memory Leak**
A memory leak is a way of manipulating memory and it is an unintentional form of memory consumption whereby the developer fails to free an allocated block of memory when no longer needed. The consequences of such an issue depend on the application itself. Consider the following general three cases:

-   **Short Lived User-land Application**: Little if any noticable effect. Modern operating system recollects lost memory after program termination.
-   **Long Lived User-land Application**: Potentially dangerous. These applications continue to waste memory over time, eventually consuming all RAM resources. Leads to abnormal system behavior.
-   **Kernel-land Process**: Very dangerous. Memory leaks in the kernel level lead to serious system stability issues. Kernel memory is very limited compared to user land memory and should be handled cautiously.
2. [[#Pointer Object Dereference]]

## SSL Stripping
---
Secure sockets layer (SSL) stripping or SSL Downgrade is a man in the middle attack against all SSL and early versions of TLS connections. This is a way to strip away the encryption since their employees are constantly on the move and require access to Internet on-the-go even through open non-secure Wi-Fi hotspots.

## Driver Manipulation
---
Our device drivers have direct access to hardware and the operating system, this is why, they are a great place to put a piece of malicious software that it is installed in our operating systems. These drivers sit between the hardware and the operating system itself. They are effectively privileged code that is running, very much trusted by the operating system. So this would be a great place to embed some malicious software.

### Shimming
Application shimming is a **Windows Application Compatibility** framework that Windows created to allow programs to run on versions of the OS that they were not initially created to run on. Malware authors have discovered they can write their own shims to get around security like the User Access Control (AUC).

### Refactoring
**Refactoring or metamorphic** virus is one that can transform based on the ability to translate, edit and rewrite its own code. It is considered the most infectious computer virus, and it can do serious damage to a system if it is not detected quickly. Antivirus scanners have a difficult time detecting this type of virus because it can change its internal structure, rewriting and reprogramming itself each time it infects a computing system. This is different from a **polymorphic virus**, which encrypts its original code to keep it from being detected. Because of their complexity, creating metamorphic viruses requires extensive programming knowledge.
