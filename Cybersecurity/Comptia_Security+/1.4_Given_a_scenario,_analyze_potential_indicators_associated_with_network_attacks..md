# Network Attack Indicators

## Wireless
Wireless technology is very common networking technology that has substantial number of standards and processes to connect users to network via a radio signal, thus freeing machines from wires. As in all software systems, wireless networkig is a target for hackers.This is partly because of the simple fact that wireless removes the physical barrier.
### Evil Twin
An **Evil Twin** attack is a spoofing cyberattack that works by tricking users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an "evil twin" network, hackers can access everything from their network traffic to private login credentials. 

This attack uses an AP owned by an attacker that usually has been enhanced with higher-power and higher-gain antennas to look like a better connection to the users attaching to it.

This can give an attacker an opportunity to perfom man in the middle attacks. An attacker can also perfom DOS by jamming the wireless signal, not allowing any computer to connect to the access point successfully.

### Rogue access point
A rougue access point is a device not sanctioned by an administrator, but is operating on the network anyway. This could be an access point set up by either an employee or by an intruder. The AP could also belong to a nearby company.

By setting up a **rogue access point**, an attacker can attempt to get clients to connet to it  as if it were authorized and  then simply authenticate to the real AP.


##### Difference between a rogue AP and Evil twin
A rogue AP is usually placed on an internal network either by accident or for nefarious reasons. It is not administered by the network owner or administrator. An evil twin is an AP that appears to be legitimate but isn't and is often used to eavesdrop on wireless communications.


### Bluesnarfing
**Bluesnarfing** is similar to bluejacking in that is uses the same contact transmission protocol. It is a theft of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection. The attacker copies off the victim's information.

Bluesnarfing used to require a laptop with bluetooth adapter, making it easy to identify a possible attacker, but bluesnarfing mobile apps are no available. Bloover, a combination of Bluetooth and Hoover is an example.

Attackers do it by sneaking into mobile devices, laptops, tablets, or PDA whose connection has been left open by thei owners. It implies exploiting Bluetooth vulnerabilities in order to grab such data as text or email messages, contact list, and more. It's easy to become a victim of bluesnarfing attack if you have the habit of using Bluetooth in public places and you phone is usually in discoverable mode.

### Bluejacking
**Bluejacking** is a term used for sending of unauthorized messages to another Bluetooth device. This involves sending a message as phonebook contact. 

The attacker then sends the message to the possible recipient via Bluetooth. Originally, this involved sending text messages, but more recent phones can send images or audio as well. A popular variant of this is the transmission of “shock” images, featuring disturbing or crude photos. As Bluetooth is a short-range protocol, the attack and victim must be within roughly 10 yards of each other. The victim’s phone must also have Bluetooth enabled and must be in discoverable mode. On some early phones, this was the default configuration, and while it makes connecting external devices easier, it also allows attacks against the phone. If Bluetooth is turned off, or if the device is set to non-discoverable, bluejacking can be avoided.

Bluejacking can be prevented by setting a device to hidden, invisible or non-discoverable mode.

### Disassociation
It is a type of DoS attack in which the attacker breaks the wireless connection between the victim device and the access point. The method is based on the use of special disassociation frame specified under the IEEE 802.11. Transferring such frames to the target device breaks the connection, and the Wi-Fi protocol does not require any encryption for it. For a successful attack, the cyber-criminal needs to know only the victim's MAC address.

These kinds of attacks are not typically used alone. For instance, if you disassociate a connection and then sniff the re-connection, you can steal passwords. After a machine is disassociated, the use attempting to reestablish a WPA/WPA2/WPA3 session will need to repeat the four-way handshake.

Tool such as **Wifiphisher** are used to collect passwords.

### Jamming
**Jamming** is a form of DoS that specifically targets the radio spectrum aspect of wireless. Just as other DoS attacks can manipulate things behind the scenes, so can jamming on wireless AP, enabling action such as attaching to a rogue AP.

### Radio frequency identification (RFID)
 RFID tags are a type of tracking system that uses radio frequency to search, identify, track and communicate with items and people. These tags come in several different forms and can be classified as either active or passive. **Active tags** are a power source, while **passive tags** utilize the RF energy transmitted to them for power.

RFID tags have multiple security concerns. First and foremost, because they are connected via RF energy, physical security is a challenge.

Several different attack types can be performed against RFID systems:
- Against the RFID devices themselves (the chips and readers).
- Against the communication channel between the device and the reader. This kind of attack is relatively easy because the radio frequencies are known and devices exist to interface with tags.
- Against the reader and back-end system. 

The two main attacks are replay and eavesdropping. In a replay attack, the RFID information is recorded and then replayed later. In the case of eavesdropping, the data can be collected, monitoring the movements of tags for whatever purpose needed by an unauthorized party. 

Furthermore, MiTM attacks are possible, as they would be a combination of sniffing (eavesdropping) action followed by a replay (spoofing) attack. With this information the RFID tag can be cloned, if not protected via cryptographic component.

### Near-field communication (NFC)
**NFC** is a short-range wireless connectivity technology that uses magnetic field induction to enable communication between devices when they're touched together or brought within a few centimeters of each other. This includes authenticating credit cards, enabling physical access, transferring small files and jump starting more capable wireless links.

Now that this technology has become the mainstream method of making payments via mobile phones, it is becoming ubiquitous, and in many cases is connected directly to financial information. Therefore, the importance of understanding and protecting this communication channel is paramount.

>**NOTE**: It is important to know that RFID is a process by which a credit card or phone communicates with a reader using radio waves and that NFC is a high-frequency subset of RFID and acts over a much shorter distance.

### Initialization Vector(IV)
It is used to avoid repetition during the data encryption process, making it impossible for hackers who use dictionary attack to decrypt the exchange encrypted message by discovering. IV is used in wireless systems as the randomization element at the beginning of a connection.


## On-path attacks(MiTM, MiTB)
A **man in the middle** attack, as the name implies, generally occurs when an attacker is able to place himself in the middle of two other hosts that are communicating. This is done so that the traffic of the two victims will pass through the attacker. The attacker can then observe all traffic before relaying it and can actually modify or block traffic.

![[Pasted image 20220612205614.png]]
 A successful MiTM execution has two distinct phases: **interception** and **decryption**.

### Interception
The first step is to intercept traffic through the attacker's network before it reaches its intended destination. The most command and simplest way of doing this is a passive attack in which an attacker makes free, and malicious WiFi hotspots available to the public.

Attacker wishing to take a more active approach to interception may launch one of the following attacks:
- **IP Spoofing**. Involves disguising oneself as an application by altering packet headers in IP Address. As a result, users attempting to access a URL connected to the application are sent to the attackers' website.
- **ARP Spoofing**. Is the process of linking an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate user on a LAN using fake ARP messages. As a result, data sent by the user to the host IP is instead transmitted to the attacker.
- **DNS Spoofing**. also known as **DNS cache poisoning**, involves infiltrating a DNS server and altering a website's address record. As a result, users attempting to access the site are sent by the altered DNS record to the attacker's site.

### Decryption
After interception, any two-way SSL traffic needs to be decrypted without alerting the user or application. A number of methods exist to achieve this:
- **HTTPS Spoofing** send a phony certificate to the victim's browser once the initial connection request to a secure site is made. It holds a digital thumbprint associated with the compromised application, which the browser verifies according to an existing list of trusted sites. The attacker is then able to access any data entered by the victim before it’s passed to the application.
- **SSL Beast** (browser exploit against SSL/TLS) targets a TLS version 1.0 vulnerability in SSL. Here, the victim’s computer is infected with malicious JavaScript that intercepts encrypted cookies sent by a web application. Then the app’s cipher block chaining (CBC) is compromised so as to decrypt its cookies and authentication tokens.
- **SSL hijacking** occurs when an attacker passes forged authentication keys to both the user and application during a TCP handshake. This sets up what appears to be a secure connection when, in fact, the man in the middle controls the entire session.
-  **SSL stripping** downgrades a HTTPS connection to HTTP by intercepting the TLS authentication sent from the application to the user. The attacker sends an unencrypted version of the application’s site to the user while maintaining the secured session with the application. Meanwhile, the user’s entire session is visible to the attacker.

**man in the browser** attack is a variant of MiTM. But in this case a Trojan Horse is used to intercept and manipulate calls between the main application's executable (e.g. the browser) and its security mechanisms or libraries on-the-fly. According Mike Meyers, the first element if a malware attack that takes place a trojan element that can act as a proxy on the target machine. This malware changes malware behavior through browser helper objects or extensions.

## Layer 2 attacks
### Address Resolution
Devices need to know where to send a packet suing the MAC or Layer 2 address. Address Resolution Protocol handles this problem through four basic message types:
- **ARP request** "Who has this IP address?"
- **ARP reply** "I have that IP address; my Mac address is..."
- **Reverse ARP request (RARP)** "Who has this MAC address?"
- **RARP Reply** "I have that MAC address; my IP address is..."

### Protocol (ARP) poisoning
This is done by corrupting the ARP tables of network devices and endpoints, usually in order to perform MiTM attacks or spoofing. According to Radware, **ARP Poisoning** is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN in order to change the pairings in its IP to MAC address table. 

There is no mechanism to verify the veracity of the data received. An attacker can send messages, corrupt the ARP table, and cause packets to be misrouted. This can allow a mechanism whereby an attacker can inject himself into the middle of a conversation between two devices.

### Media access control (MAC) flooding
**MAC address flooding attack or CAM table flooding attack** is where an attacker connected to a switch port floods the switch interface with very large number of Ethernet frames with different fake source MAC address.
**Before CAM table flooding**
![[Pasted image 20220613230939.png]]
**After CAM table flooding**
![[Pasted image 20220613230952.png]]
As you can see in the image, the MAC address table of the target switch is being overflowed with mac address entries. This causes the switch  to use up all its limited memory and causes it to not save any more MAC address. Once the MAC address table is full and can no longer save any more addresses, it enters into a fail-open mode and will start behaving like a HUB or repeater.

### Mac cloning
It is an act of changing a MAC address to bypass security checks based on the MAC address. This can work when the return packets are being routed by IP address and can be properly linked to the correct MAC address. 

Not all MAC cloning is an attack; small firewall routers commonly have a MAC clone function by which the device can clone a MAC  address to make it seem transparent to other devices such as the cable modem connection.

## Domain name system(DNS)
DNS is for domain names to be translated to IP address, so that it can be routed through the network. This makes DNS a primary target for attackers, because if you corrupt DNS, you can control where all the packets go.

### Domain hijacking
Is an act of changing the registration of a domain name without permission of its original registrant. This enables the attackers to make unauthorized changes and transfers to their advantage. The original owner can request it to be corrected, but this can take time.

The easiest and most common way is by changing the administrator's handle information through social engineering or hacking into the administrators email account.

### DNS poisoning
Also known as DNS cache poisoning or DNS spoofing, is  a highly deceptive attack in which attackers redirect web traffic toward fake web servers and phishing websites. These fake sites typically look like the user's intended destination, making it easy for hackers to trick visitors into sharing sensitive information.

> You can see the DNS information of a specific website with **nslookup**. At times, **nslookup** will return a nonauthoritative answer, this typically means the result is from a cache as opposed to a server that has a authoritative answer.

### Uniform Resource Locator (URL) redirection
**URL** is the method of describing where you want a browser to go, and it is the main interface to the DNS process that converts it to a machine-readable address.

An https parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. 

### Domain reputation
You IP address is an address, much like the one for you house, and like all addresses it can have a reputation. Do you live in a good neighborhood, or a bad one? If you do not protect you address, its reputation may suffer. Security companies track where spam comes from, and if your IP address becomes associated with spam, botnets, malware, or other bad behaviors, your domain reputation will suffer. Also, many interconnected services will literally stop working if your score gets low enough.

**How do you prevent this from happening?**
Start with making certain others are not piggybacking on your address. Open mail relays can lead to spamming. Bots can abuse APIs. The attacker that use these channels don't care about your domain reputation; when it gets too low, they move to another victim. Maintaining a secure system is how you keep this from happening.

## Distributed denial-of-service(DDoS)
**DoS** attack, attempts to deny authorized user access either to specific information or to the computer system or network itself. This can be accomplished by crashing the system -- taking it offline -- or by sending so many requests that the machine is overwhelmed.

A DoS attack employing multiple attacking systems is known as a <i>distributed denial-of-service(DDoS)</i> attack. DDoS attacks were made famous in 2000 with the highly publicized attacks on eBay, CNN, Amazon, and Yahoo!
![[Pasted image 20220617181647.png]]

To prevent a DDoS attack, you must be able either to intercept or block the attack messages or to keep the DDoS network from being established in the first place.  There are tools to scan systems,  searching for sleeping zombies waiting for an attack signal.

### Network
The purpose of DDoS/DoS attack is to prevent access to the target system, and blocking network connections will do this. One method, a SYN flooding attack, can be used to prevent service to a system temporarily in order to take advantage of a trusted relationship that exist between that system and another.
SYN flooding is an example of a DoS attack that takes advantage of the way TCP/IP networks were designed to function, and it can be used to illustrate the basic principles of any DoS attack. **SYN flooding** uses the TCP three-way handshake that establishes a connection between two systems. Under normal circumstances, the first system sends a SYN packet to the system with which it wants to communicate. The second system responds with a SYN/ACK flag if it is able to accept the request. When the initial system receives the SYN/ACK from the second system, it responds with an ACK packet, and communication can then proceed.![[Pasted image 20220617212919.png]]
#### SYN Flooding attack
In this attack the attacker sends fake communication requests to the targeted system. Each of these requests will be answered by the target system, which then waits for the third part of the handshake. Since the request are fake (a nonexistent IP address is used int he request, so the target system is responding to a system that doesn't exist), the target will wait for responses that never came. The target system will drop these connection after a specific time-out period, but if the attacker send requests faster than the time-out period eliminates them, the system will quickly be filled with requests.

A system can support a finite amount of connections, so when more requests come in than can be processed, the system will soon be reserving all its connections for fake requests. At this point, any further requests are simply dropped (ignored), and legitimate users who want to connect to the target system will not be able to do so, because of the system denying them. ![[Pasted image 20220617213848.png]]
#### Ping of Death(POD)
It is a type of DoS attack in which an attacker attempts to crash, destabilize, or freeze the target computer or service by sending malformed or over-sized packets using the ping command.
While PoD attack exploit legacy weaknesses which may have been patched. However, in unpatched systems, the attack is still relevant,

This attack uses ICMP packets equal to, or exceeding, 64KB (which to say, greater than 64 x 1024 = 65,535 bytes). This type of packet should not occur naturally (there is no reason for a ICMP packet to be larger than 64KB). Some systems are not able to handle the size of the packet, and the system will freeze or crash.

### Application
Applications take user inputs, process data and create user outputs. This activity takes resources, and the objective of an application-level DDoS attack is to consume all the resources or to put the system into a failed state.

One of the most common targets of an application layer attack is HTTP. Because of the nature of the protocol and because the requester's to the application are typically outside of the local network, the packets are not spoofed, and detection of attack packets versus legitimate packets is challenging.

### Operational Technology(OT)
It is the name given to networks of industrial devices in cyber-physical systems. These devices use computers to control physical processes--from traffic lights, to refineries, to manufacturing plants, etc. OT systems process thousands of industrial processes under computer control. These systems of OT-specific protocols that are used to perform the communications of equipment control.

These systems do not perform correctly when communications are interrupted, so DoS attacks of any kind, including DDoS, can result in significant problems. For these reasons and more, OT systems are not directly connected to the internet and they have significant barriers preventing outside packets from getting into these networks.

## Malicious code or script execution
Scripts and automation in systems helps improve speed, accuracy and reproducibility, and probability as well as offer a ton of other advantages. These are also the reason why attackers use them as well.

### Powershell
It is a built-in command-line tool suite that has a rich set of Microsoft Windows commands. This is why attackers love Powershell--it is there, enabled, powerful and not monitored by most security systems. A wide range of  toolsets built to leverage the power of Powershell can be used to attack a system. A very commonly used tool is PowerSploit, which includes routines such as Invoke-Mimikatz.
