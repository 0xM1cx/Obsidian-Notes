**PrintNightmare** also known as CVE-2021-1675 and CVE-2021-34527.

Microsoft defines the [Print spooler service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-prsod/7262f540-dd18-46a3-b645-8ea9b59753dc) as a service that runs on each computer system. As you can guess from the name, the Print spooler service manages the printing processes. The Print spooler's responsibilities are managing the print jobs, receiving files to be printed, queueing them, and scheduling.

You are able to Start/Stop/Pause/Resume the Print Spooler Service by simply navigating to Services on your Windows system.
