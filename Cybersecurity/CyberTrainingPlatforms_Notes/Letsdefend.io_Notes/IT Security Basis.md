## Inventory
Protecting your infrastructure required knowing:
- What devices are connected to your network
- What applications are being used
- Who has access to them
- What security measures are in place


### What should your inventory contain and why?
With all IT security issues, you will need a complete inventory. This should at least contain the following:
- the hardware of each workstation and server
- the software installed with the exact version
- the date of the last report


### End-of-life Equipment of assets in inventory 
Equipment(hardware and software) that is not longer maintained is equipment that will no longer receive security patches. It is then necessary to exclude from your network all the equipment that cannot be maintained. 

In the case of extreme necessity, a risk acceptance by the CISO(Chief Information Security Officer) must be performed and traced in your inventory. This analysis must be reviewed at regular intervals, ideally at each new vulnerability. 

### Secure Boot on assets
Secure boot must be enabled on all compatible devices. This feature ensures that the computer *boots using only manufacturer-approved software*. This is a feature that has been available for 10 years, so it is unlikely that a problem will occur if you have standard usage. 

### Software list in Inventory
To reduce the attack surface, companies must have a strict policy regarding authorized and unauthorized softwares

#### Allowed Softwares

#### Forbidden Softwares
