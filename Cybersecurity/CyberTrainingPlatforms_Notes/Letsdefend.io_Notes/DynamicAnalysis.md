## What is Dynamic Malware Analysis?
Dynamic malware is an analysis method in which malware is run and examined in secure environments. This method is aimed at analyzing the behavior of malware by examining the activities like, network, and file, etc. in secure environments.

This analysis method is widely preferred by SOC analysts, as it a faster than static analysis method. Various sandbox solutions are available to automate the dynamic analysis. **Sandboxes** run the malware in their own isolated environments and automatically present the analysis results.

### Advantages of the Dynamic Analysis Method
- It produces much faster results than the static analysis method.
- You can perform automated analysis with sandboxes.
- It is an analysis method that requires less technical knowledge than static analysis, so beginners can learn easily.

### Disadvantages of the Dynamic Analysis Method
- You cannot determine the full malware capacity, as the behavior of the malware may vary from different systems.
- You cannot usually analyze advanced malware with the dynamic analysis method alone, in these cases you may need to use both dynamic and static analysis together.

## Importance of Dynamic Malware Analysis for SOC Analysts
If you ask a SOC analyst about what they do at work, one of the things you may probably hear will be that "I am analyzing suspicious files".

Malware analysis is one of the most important tasks of SOC. A cybersecurity professional will work with malware in their daily life.

As a SOC analyst, you are racing against time. The faster you can detect a harmful situation, the faster you can take action against it. SOC analysts first prefer the dynamic analysis method since it can produce much faster results than the static analysis.
