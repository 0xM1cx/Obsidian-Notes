## Windows Filesystem
### What is a File System?
A **File system** is a data structure that maintains the order of digital storage areas, and whose unit is a file. The OS cannot make sense of the space on the disk without the file system. It cannot know which data group is on the disk as a file. So the file system is a very important component for running the OS. File systems have different types of data structures. This data structures can be different for each file system.

### File Systems Used in Windows
File systems have also been developed, like every technology that has developed from the past to the present. With the development of technology, the need for new file systems has emerged due to increased processing power and storage capacity. Therefore, different file systems have been developed continuously and released to the market. Some of these file systems used in Windows OS are given below.

#### FAT
**File Allocation Table** file system was developed and released for personal computers in 1977. Although the purpose of its emergence was to be used on floppy disks, it was adapted to be used in hard drives and other devices over time. The FAT file system is no the default file system for Microsoft Windows OS today. Today, it is used in USB flash drives, flash drives, and other embedded systems.

#### exFat
Extensible File Allocation Table (exFAT) is a file system introduced by Microsoft in 2006 and optimized for flash memory such as USB flash drives and SD cards.
