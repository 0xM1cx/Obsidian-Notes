**Open source intelligence (OSINT)** is the practice of collecting information from published or otherwise publicly available sources.

- **Maltego** -  specializes in uncovering relationships among people, companies, domains and publicly accessible information on the internet. The Maltego program works by automating the searching of different public data sources, so users can click on one button and execute multiple queries. A search plan is called a “transform action” by the program, and Maltego comes with quite a few by default that include common sources of public information like DNS records, whois records, search engines and social networks. Because the program is using public interfaces to perform its searching, it’s compatible with almost any source of information that has a public interface, so adding more searches to a transform action or making up a whole new one is easily possible.

- **Mitaka** - Available as a Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mitaka/bfjbejmeoibbdpfdbmbacmefcbannnbg) and Firefox [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mitaka/), [Mitaka](https://github.com/ninoseki/mitaka) lets you search over six dozen search engines for IP addresses, domains, URLs, hashes, ASNs, Bitcoin wallet addresses, and various indicators of compromise (IOCs) from your web browser.
   
- **SpiderFoot** - is a free OSINT reconnaissance tool that integrates with multiple data sources to gather and analyze IP addresses, CIDR ranges, domains and subdomains, ASNs, email addresses, phone numbers, names and usernames, BTC addresses, etc.
  
- **Spyse** - Spyse collects publicly available data on websites, their owners, associated servers, and IoT devices. This data is then analyzed by the Spyse engine to spot any security risks in and connections between these different entities.
