Research Design Chosen: Descriptive and Correlational
**Descriptive** -  research aims to describe the characteristics of a population or phenomenon. It does not involve manipulation or control of variables. Surveys, observational studies, and case studies are common methods used in descriptive research. This design is useful for generating hypotheses and understanding the current state of a topic.

**Correlational** - research examines the relationship between two or more variables without manipulating them. Correlation does not imply causation, but it helps identify associations between variables. Correlational designs are useful for studying naturally occurring phenomena and making predictions.

## Notes
- **Precision Agriculture** - is an approach to farming that uses real-time data to manage environmental variations, measure performance to improve upon passed seasons, and perform predictive analysis to make better farming decision, which result in higher production yields with lower production costs.  
- Sensor networks are setup in fields to collect real-time environmental data.  
- Vertical farming is often considered a form of sustainable agriculture due to its potential to address several challenges associated with conventional agriculture.
- Hydroponics is a method of cultivating plants without soil, where the plants receive all necessary nutrients through a nutrient-rich water solution.
