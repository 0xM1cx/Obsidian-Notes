### Overview
A network scanner is a tool used for analyzing hosts that are available on the network. Two of the most basic methods for scanning the network include an ICMP echo request and TCP scan.

Create a basic network scanner using a popular programming language such as Python to scan through a list of IP addresses and identify possible hosts on the network.
